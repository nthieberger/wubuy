  <h1>3.8 w-Insertion P-7.</h1>
<p>The alternations discussed in this section, though superficially resembling those seen in the preceding section, are sufficiently distinct in detail to justify separate treatment.</p>
<p>The NA and N<sup>g</sup>ARA nonhuman noun classes are marked, in what I call the Continuous series, by prefixes <span id = "nuy">/na-/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span>  respectively. In the Punctual series the two are merged as <span id = "nuy">/yi:-/</span> (ยง4.7).</p>
<p>Several nouns in these classes begin with short <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  After <span id = "nuy">/na-/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span> the usual VV-Contraction rule P-49 applies and we get such forms as <span id = "nuy">//na-a<u>r</u>agu//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/na:-'<u>r</u>agu/</span> 'the young male dugong' and <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>ara-a<u>n</u>arag//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara:-'<u>n</u>arag/</span> 'the young goanna'. However, with prefix <span id = "nuy">/yi;-/</span> VV-Contraction does not occur (since the prefix vowel is long). For some speakers the outputs are <span id = "nuy">/yi:-ya<u>r</u>agu/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/yi:-ya<u>n</u>arag/</span>  with surface <span id = "nuy">/y/</span>  However, other speakers (especially younger and middle-aged ones) prefer <span id = "nuy">/yi:-wa<u>r</u>agu/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/yi:-wa<u>n</u>arag/</span>  with surface <span id = "nuy">/w/</span>  in all such forms. For the <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> dialect, a rule inserting the <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> is needed, and even speakers of the <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> dialect are compatible with this analysis, since <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> usually becomes surface <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> in the environment <span id = "nuy">/i__a/</span> (see P-9 and P-10).</p>
<p>For some (apparently most) speakers of the <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> dialect, in the one relevant case where the noun root begins with long <span id = "nuy">/a:/</span> we get <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> instead of <span id = "nuy">/w/</span>  the form being <span id = "nuy">/yi:-ya:mun<sup>y</sup>/</span> 'common fly' from <span id = "nuy">/a:mun<sup>y</sup>/</span>  This suggests that <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> is not inserted in this form, except for certain speakers who do say <span id = "nuy">/yi:-wa:mun<sup>y</sup>/</span></p>
<table>
<tr><td>(P-7)</td><td>w-Insertion (for some speakers, mostly young)</td></tr>
<tr><td /><td>&#216;	&#8594; w // yi:-___a</td></tr>
<tr><td /><td>where <span id = "nuy">/yi:-/</span> is the noun class prefix, and (for most speakers) the <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> is short</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Reasons for dissociating this rule from <a href = "FGN-3-7.html#P-6">P-6</a> are that the latter applies only in a long-vowel form (with <span id = "nuy">/a:/</span>) while P-7 applies for most speakers only in short-vowel forms, and that P-6 applies only to a root preceded by a derivational prefix or compound initial while P-7 applies after an inflectional prefix.</p>
<p>P-7 is designed to apply to forms involving nouns which clearly begin with <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  or for which there is no specific evidence that there is any underlying segment (such as a semivowel) preceding the <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  It should be noted that there are some other stems which appear to begin with underlying <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>a/</span> which loses its <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> in some surface environments (including word-initial position). For these roots (which normally cannot undergo VV-Contraction P-49, for example) an alternation of the type word-initial <span id = "nuy">/a.../</span> vs. prefixed <span id = "nuy">/yi:-wa.../</span> need not be due to P-7. The latter rule applies to all nouns beginning in <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> which occur after <span id = "nuy">/yi:-/</span>  including those which clearly have underlying initial <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> instead of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>a/</span>  such as <span id = "nuy">/ala:di/</span> 'bad'.</p>
