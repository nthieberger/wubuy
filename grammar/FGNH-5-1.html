<h2>5.1 General</h2>
<p>A separate chapter is reserved for kin terms because of their relatively substantial number of special morphological features.</p>
<p>The differences are essentially in stem-formation, including number-marking and a type of NC<sub>der</sub> prefixation. Kin terms take the same inflectional noun-class (NC<sub>infl</sub>) suffixes used by other nouns §<a href="FGNH-4-7.html">4.7</a>, §<a href="FGNH-4-8.html">4.8</a>), with minor variations in form due to specialised Phonological rules (<a href="FGNH-3-35.html">P-34</a>, <a href="FGNH-3-36.html">P-35</a>). They also take regular nominal case suffixes (§<a href="FGNH-4-18.html">4.18</a>ff.) and postpositional suffixes (§<a href="FGNH-4-32.html">4.32</a>).</p>
<p>In this chapter we are therefore mainly concerned with stem morphology. Paradigms for the various kin categories are presented. In comparison with the preceding chapter, fewer textual crossreferences are given, since textual occurrences in NMET are given in dictionary entries.</p>
<p>The kinship system is classificatory, which means that every Aboriginal person is in a specific kinship relationship to every other Aboriginal, even if the precise genealogical connection is not known. Thus each term like 'father' ('Fa') applies not only to one's actual (i.e., presumed biological) father, but also by simple extensions to father's brother (FaBr), by more complex extensions to FaFaBrSo, and to many other persons including some in lower generations and some noncolineal relatives. Abbreviations used are <u>Fa</u>(ther), <u>Br</u>(other) , <u>Mo(</u>ther), <u>Si</u>(ster), <u>So</u>(n) , <u>Da </u>(ughter), <u>Ch</u>(ild), <u>Pa</u>(rent) , <u>Hu</u>(sband), <u>Wi</u>(fe) , <u>Sp</u>(ouse), and <u>Sb</u> (Sibling). Compounds like FaFaSi indicate relational products: father's father's sister. The symbols ♂ and ♀ specify male and female, respectively, and are used to distinguish, for example, ♂So (man's son) from ♀ Sο (woman's son).</p>
<p>One important structural feature of Nunggubuyu terminology is that siblings call all other kinsmen by the same terms. In English this is true of ascending kinsmen but not of descending kinsmen (if X is the sibling of Y, the child of X is the nephew or niece of Y). In Nunggubuyu this is true not only of ascending but also of descending and "affinal" or "spouse" categories. Another impor-</p>
<p>tant feature is that "affinal" and "spouse" kin categories are not a separate set or subset of the terminology. Rather, since choice of spouse (and hence of affines) is sharply delimited by the genealogical kinship system, terms for affines and spouses are identical to existing genealogical terms. Thus the term for 'MoMoBrDaDa' (and similar second cross-cousins) is also used for ♂Wi (and anyone's BrWi), and the term for 'MoMoBrDa' is applied to the Mo of one's Wi. Ordinarily, one marries "correctly" with the result that no change in preexisting applications of kin terms is needed. "Incorrect" marriages (there is actually a range of acceptability going from mildly incorrect to absolutely taboo), which have always occurred and which are more common nowadays under settlement conditions, normally result in a change in terminology so that 'MoMoBrDaDa' is applied to Wi, with corresponding changes for certain important affines.</p>
<p>In an expression like 'Fa of X', we describe X (grammatically possessive in English) as the propositus (i.e., reference point), and X's father as the referent. This terminology is applicable to ordinary (linear) kin terms which define the referent in terms of his/her relationship to a given propositus. However, the language also has dyadic kin terms of the type 'a Fa-and-Ch pair' (§<a href="FGNH-5-6.html">5.6</a>), where we can only speak of referent<sub>1</sub> and referent<sub>2</sub> whose mutual relationship is specified (but whose relationship to any external propositus is unspecified).</p>
<p>The basic system of categories is indicated in Figure 5-1. The actual forms shown are Vocatives, equivalent to referential forms with 1st person propositus (in the latter function, 'my/our...', NC<sub>infl</sub> prefixes and other nominal affixes may be present, often making distinctions between male/female referent which are not specified lexically). Referential forms with 2nd and with 3rd person propositus differ in form from the items shown in the figure. The 2nd and 3rd person forms usually display the same categorial oppositions of kin terms indicated in the figure, but there are some differences in terms for siblings and for second cross-cousins.</p>
<p>Abbreviations used are: VOC = Vocative</p>
<p>PROP<sub>1</sub> = 1st person propositus</p>
<p>PROP<sub>2</sub> = 2nd. person propositus</p>
<p>PROP<sub>3</sub> = 3rd. person propositus</p>
<p>The pronominal categories of propositus marked in the kin term are person only. PROP<sub>1</sub> is for 'my/our...', PROP<sub>2</sub> for 'your...', PROP<sub>3</sub> for 'his<span id="nuy">/her/</span>their...'. PROP<sub>1</sub> includes exclusive as well as inclusive first person, and all persons include all numbers. Finer pronominal specification of propositus requires a modifying independent pronoun (usually in the same case as the kin term).</p>
<p>In Figure 5-1, kinsmen in the same generation linked by a horizontal line over them are siblings, and kinsmen linked by a horizontal line under them are (real or classificatory) spouses (equivalent to second cross cousins). Looked at in terms of patrilineal "lines," there are four, each with completely distinctive terminology. Collapsing of 2A and 2D generations occurs in terms within Ego's own patrilineal line. Omaha-type skewing of terms down through contiguous generations in a patriline occurs in Mo's and MoMo's lines (1A = 0 = 1D generations).</p>
<p><a href="https://iiif.drdanielrb.com/iiif/2/HeathGrammar-223.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg">Figure 5-1 Kinship System</a></p>
    <p>Aside from this Omaha-type skewing (which occurs also in some other nearby languages such as Mara and Anindilyakwa), the system is of the "Aranda type" as this term is used in Australian ethnography.</p>
<p>The patrilineal moieties are called <span id="nuy">/yirija/</span> and <span id="nuy">/mandha:yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> (see dictionary entry for forms; <span id="nuy">/mandha:yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> is replaced in human Sg and Du by forms of the stem <span id="nuy">/mi<u>n</u>iguya/</span> ). There are no named sections or subsections, though the Nunggubuyu are aware of subsections in neighboring groups. There are no named generation moieties like the harmonic/disharmonic generation-moieties in many Australian groups (note that the kinship terminology would not articulate with such a system well). On the other hand, it could be argued that Nunggubuyu does have a virtual semimoiety system in which each patrilineal moiety is divided into two distinct patrilineal divisions, as with Mara to the south. Not only does the kinship terminology conform to this pattern; in addition, the rituals are organised largely around a four-way grouping of clans into sets of "brother" clans. Some Nunggubuyu clan terms, especially <span id="nuy">/murun<sup>g</sup>un/</span>, can be applied to any "brother" clan of the focal Nunggubuyu clan(s) of this name, and thus function like Mara semimoiety terms. For more information on clan names and the like, see pp. 5-6 of NMET and pp. 327-29 of the dictionary.</p>
<p>There are no matrilineal moieties, semimoieties, or clans. Individual matrifiliative sequences (a woman X, her Da Y, and Y's Da Z) are important in defining specific marital claims (if a man A married X back two generations, A's SiDaSo has a specific right to claim Z, thus renewing the intermarriage pattern among these lines of women (including their brothers) every second generation. However, these concrete matrifiliative sequences are not expanded culturally into large-scale matrilineal moieties or clans.</p>
<p>An adult man of a clan C<sub>1</sub> may be considered the <span id="nuy">/abal/</span> 'boss' of the clan, its rituals, and its estate (territory); the compound <span id="nuy">/lhal-abal/</span> 'country-boss' is also used. He also has a special relationship called <span id="nuy">/jun<sup>g</sup>gayi/</span>, conventionally glossed 'manager', to his Mo's clan C<sub>2</sub>; this involves specific ritual duties such as painting clan designs on dancers, but also a general overseeing for the men of C<sub>2</sub> with special reference to ritual life. A similar but minor relationship of a man to his MoMo's clan C<sub>3</sub> is called <span id="nuy">/niga<u>r</u>a<u>r</u>ij/</span>.</p>
