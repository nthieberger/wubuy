  <h1>3.16 iy-Contraction  P-15.</h1>
<p>There is a rule (V-Fronting P-50) which converts <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/u/</span> into <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> before palatoalveolar <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span>  There are also some apparent cases of <span id = "nuy">//ay//</span> or <span id = "nuy">//uy//</span> becoming <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> in similar positions. It is reasonable to consider these as cases where V-Fronting converts <span id = "nuy">//ay//</span> or <span id = "nuy">//uy//</span> to <span id = "nuy">//iy//</span>  which is then reduced to <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> by a rule we will call iy-Contraction.</p>
<p>In the case of <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>a<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>gay/</span> 'spear shaft', the two rules fail to apply in the noun forms, which require derivational noun class prefix, hence <span id = "nuy">/ma-ga<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>gay/</span> from <span id = "nuy">//maG-w<sub>1</sub>a<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>gay//</span> 'spear shaft (MANA class)'. However, the rules apply in case the stem is used as a compound initial (with following verb stem), as in <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>a<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>gi=ma-/</span> 'to pick up spear (shaft)'. See Table 14-2.</p>
<p>In the case of verb <span id = "nuy">/=lha-/</span> 'to stand', the usual Past<sub>2</sub> inflected form is <span id = "nuy">/=lha-y/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">/wuru=lha-y/</span> 'they stood'. This form never contracts. However, with a preceding compound initial or a derivational prefix like Multiple <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>aragara-/</span>  the form <span id = "nuy">/=lha-y/</span> frequently reduces to <span id = "nuy">/=lhi-&#216;/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">/wu-waragara=lhi-&#216;/</span> 'they (ANA class) were all standing (e.g., trees)'. The full form <span id = "nuy">/wu-waragara=lha-y/</span> is also possible but not so common. On the other hand, the paradigmatically parallel Past<sub>2</sub> form <span id = "nuy">/=ya-y/</span> 'slept' does not reduce to  <span id = "nuy">/=yi-Ø/</span> even in compounds, the Multiple form for this stem being <span id = "nuy">/-lhagara=ya-y/</span> 'all slept'. See Table 11-5 (N<sup>g</sup>A<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>There are also some other possible cases of <span id = "nuy">//ay//</span> reducing to <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> by P-50 and P-15, but they involve fairly abstract analysis of inflectional verbal paradigms. First, the N<sup>g</sup>A<sub>1</sub> (i.e., first N<sup>g</sup>A) verb class shows stem-final <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> in most forms: Past<sub>1</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=bura-n<sup>g</sup>a-n<sup>y</sup>/</span> 'sat down', etc. However, the Past<sub>2</sub> is of the type <span id = "nuy">/=buri-&#216;/</span>  We could analyse this as <span id = "nuy">//=bura-y//</span> with P-50 and P-15 converting <span id = "nuy">//ay//</span> to <span id = "nuy">//iy//</span> and then <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  Moreover, there are clear affinities between the N<sup>g</sup>A<sub>1</sub> class and that of <span id = "nuy">/=lha-/</span> 'to stand' (preceding paragraph), which I call the N<sup>g</sup>A<sub>2</sub> type (essentially the monosyllabic-stem equivalent of the N<sup>g</sup>A<sub>1</sub> type). Again, see Table 11-5.</p>
<p>There is also a much more general inflected form for many verb classes which we here call Nonpast<sub>3</sub> (mainly used as future negative). For the great majority of stems ending in <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  the Nonpast<sub>3</sub> is of the form <span id = "nuy">/i-&#216;/</span>  Obviously, for stems ending in <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> we can regard this as a zero suffix, but for those ending in <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> it is possible to set up the suffix as <span id = "nuy">//-y//</span> with P-50 and P-15 then changing <span id = "nuy">//ay//</span> to <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  Thus <span id = "nuy">/yagi niwu=ma:<u>n</u>dhi-&#216;/</span> 'he will not make it (ANA<sub>wu</sub>)' from <span id = "nuy">/=ma:<u>n</u>dha-/</span> 'to make'. It is also possible to set up <span id = "nuy">/-y/</span> as Nonpast<sub>3</sub> suffix for the relevant stems ending in <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  so that <span id = "nuy">//i-y//</span> is also reduced to <span id = "nuy">/i-&#216;/</span> by P-15· There are one or two verbs ending in <span id = "nuy">/u/</span> which also show Nonpast<sub>3</sub> <span id = "nuy">/i-&#216;/</span>  as with <span id = "nuy">/=<u>r</u>ugu-/</span> 'to weep' (class U<sub>3</sub>) , Nonpast<sub>3</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=<u>r</u>ugi-&#216;/</span>  and of course we can set this up as <span id = "nuy">//=<u>r</u>ugu-y//</span> with P-50 and P-15 then applying (compare Past<sub>1</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=<u>r</u>ugi-n<sup>y</sup>/</span> 'wept' showing P-50 before palatoalveolar). However, there are other Nonpast<sub>3</sub> forms, notably <span id = "nuy">/u:-'/</span> for some other stems ending in <span id = "nuy">/u/</span>  where it seems that an underlying Nonpast<sub>3</sub> allomorph other than <span id = "nuy">/-y/</span> should be recognised. See Table 11-3.</p>
<p>It is possible to formulate P-15 as an automatic rule reducing <span id = "nuy">//iy//</span> to <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> in syllable-final position. The various morphological restrictions on the reduction of <span id = "nuy">//ay//</span> to <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  noted above, are restrictions on P-50 (which changes the <span id = "nuy">//a//</span> to <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> here) rather than on P-15.</p>
