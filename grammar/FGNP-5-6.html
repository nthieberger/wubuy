<h2>5.6 Dyadic kin terms</h2>
<p>The Dyadic terms are given in <a href="FGNP-51.html#T-5-1 ">Table 5-1 </a>along with the simple (linear) kin terms. Some comments on the phonology and morphology of Dyadic terms were mixed in with the commentary on <a href="FGNP-51.html#T-5-1 ">Table 5-1 </a>in §<a href="FGNP-5-4.html">5.4</a>.</p>
<p>Although the Dyadic forms present, on the whole, an archaic and irregular aspect, it appears possible to identify a primary Dyadic suffix <span id="nuy">/-yij/</span>, with variants <span id="nuy">/-nyij/</span> (often, and perhaps only, after nasal) and <span id="nuy">/-j/</span>.</p>
<p>Exx. pointing to <span id="nuy">/-yij/</span> are <span id="nuy">/anggur-yij/</span> (C.i). <span id="nuy">/nganja<u>l</u>-yij/</span> (C.ii), most likely <span id="nuy">/ali-jij/</span> (D.iii) if from <span id="nuy">/<span id="nuy">/(w)aliG-yij/</span>/</span> (the root does not otherwise occur, and the Dyadic form might also be segmented as <span id="nuy">/aliji-j/</span>) , and <span id="nuy">/ngawu-yij/</span> (A.iii, from <span id="nuy">/ngawuy/</span>). Exx. with <span id="nuy">/-nyij/</span> are <span id="nuy">/a<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> and variants (A.ii), <span id="nuy">/ni-gama-nyij/</span> and <span id="nuy">/ngarri-yama-nyij/</span> (A.iv/A.v; the root does not otherwise occur and might be set up as <span id="nuy">/-wama-/</span> or <span id="nuy">/-wamaN-/</span>), <span id="nuy">/ngaya-nyij/</span> (B.i, from <span id="nuy">/ngayang/</span>), and <span id="nuy">/rramu-nyij/</span> (D.i; root not otherwise occurring, perhaps <span id="nuy">/rramu-/</span> or <span id="nuy">/rramuN-/</span>). The form <span id="nuy">/-j/</span> is seen in <span id="nuy">/a-muri-j/</span> (A.i), <span id="nuy">/rrigi-j/</span> (B.ii), probably <span id="nuy">/ngali-j/</span> (B.iii, root not otherwise occurring), <span id="nuy">/nganngalhi-j/</span> (C.iv), and <span id="nuy">/a<u>n</u>gi-j/</span> (D.ii). The citations (e.g., "C.i"), of course, refer to entries in <a href="FGNP-51.html#T-5-1.">Table 5-1.</a> The form <span id="nuy">/ra-ngunymanji/</span> (D.v) could possibly be analysed as having an idiosyncratic ending <span id="nuy">/-nji/</span> if the sequence <span id="nuy">/ra-ngunyma.../</span> is regarded as a nasalised variant of <span id="nuy">/ra-ngujba-/</span> in the same paradigm.</p>
<p>The several Dyadic forms (excluding those with unique, suppletive roots) have differing relationships to the VOC/PROP<sub>1</sub>, PROP<sub>2</sub>, and PROP<sub>3</sub> linear kin terms. In some cases the Dyadic form is closely related to the PROP<sub>2</sub>/PROP<sub>3</sub> forms and contains the prefix <span id="nuy">/-(r)ang-/</span> which is connected with these categories: <span id="nuy">/a-muri-j/</span>, <span id="nuy">/ra-ngunymanji/</span>. In some others, however, the connection is with the VOC/PROP<sub>1</sub>, form: <span id="nuy">/ngawu-nyij/</span>, <span id="nuy">/ngaya-nyij/</span>, <span id="nuy">/rrigi-j/</span>, <span id="nuy">/nganja<u>l</u>-yij/</span>, <span id="nuy">/nganngalhi-j/</span>. In the case of <span id="nuy">/a<u>n</u>gi-j/</span> we have basically the same root in all forms so no decision can be made. In the paradigm of 'MoMo' (C.i in (<a href="FGNP-51.html#T-5-1)">Table 5-1)</a>), Dyadic <span id="nuy">/anggur-yij/</span> (after Pl prefix <span id="nuy">/-nganggur-yij/</span>) shows a stem form similar to <span id="nuy">/a-nganggur-/</span> (used in PROP<sub>2</sub> and PROP<sub>3</sub>, the latter with further suffix <span id="nuy">/-yung/</span>) rather than to VOC/PROP<sub>1</sub> <span id="nuy">/gaagu/</span>, but the Dyadic form lacks prefix <span id="nuy">/a-/</span> (from <span id="nuy">/<span id="nuy">/ang-/</span>/</span>).</p>
<p>The Dyadic stems without further number marking have dual meaning (e.g., 'Fa and Ch pair'). With Pl prefix <span id="nuy">/mij-/</span> (surface variants <span id="nuy">/mi-/</span>, <span id="nuy">/miyn-/</span> by phonological rules as described in §<a href="FGNP-5-4.html">5.4</a>), we get a Pl Dyadic form referring to three or more persons.</p>
<p>One topic which arises in connection with Dyadic kin terms is the choice of root, given that the dyad consists of two persons who often call each other by different kin terms (e.g., 'Fa and So'). This is not a problem in the case of self-reciprocal kin terms ('FaFa' = '♂SoCh', etc.), but most terms are not self-reciprocal. For these categories, the structurally senior member of the dyad furnishes the root on which the Dyadic term is constructed, as in <span id="nuy">/rrigi-j/</span> 'Mo and Ch', based on <span id="nuy">/rrigang/</span> 'Mo' rather than on terms for '♀Ch'. This specific notion of structural seniority does not depend on the actual relative age of the two referents, nor even on their relative generations. As shown in Figure 5-1, for example, persons called 'Mo' occur in the 1A, 0, and 1D generations. Rather, structural seniority in the formation of Dyadic terms is based on telescoping all instances of a kinship category into a single prototypical dyadic relationship; in the case of 'Mo', the prototypical case is of course in the ]A generation, so 'Mo' is structurally senior to its reciprocal '♀Ch', and the Dyadic term <span id="nuy">/rrigi-j/</span> is used for all dyads in which one person is <span id="nuy">/rrigang/</span> 'Mo' to the other.</p>
<p>In Nunggubuyu, this patterning is not especially clear due to the large number of suppletive Dyadic terms. However, even these suppletive cases are structurally consistent with our notion of structural seniority, since although the root is suppletive the categories distinguished are based on senior rather than junior categories. Thus, in the 1A generation 'Mo' and. 'MoBr' are distinguished as simple (linear) kin terms <span id="nuy">/rrigang/</span> and <span id="nuy">/bibi/</span>, but have the same reciprocals based on the root <span id="nuy">/marig/</span> '♀Ch, SiCh'. The Dyadic terms are <span id="nuy">/rrigi-j/</span> 'Mo and Ch' and <span id="nuy">/ngali-j/</span> 'MoBr and SiCh'. Here <span id="nuy">/ngali-j/</span> is suppletive (unlike <span id="nuy">/rrigi-j/</span>), but the mere fact that a special term for 'MoBr and SiCh' is used shows that the senior category is decisive.</p>
<p>The Dyadic terms have much lower text frequency in Nunggubuyu than in other nearby languages (e.g., Dhuwal, Mara). Some informants characterise them as "old people's language" (i.e., as archaicising), though I think that one or two of them such as <span id="nuy">/nganja<u>l</u>-yij/</span> are still in moderately common use.</p>
<p>The principal usage of Dyadic terms is as appositive interpolation or other predication, specifying the mutual relationship among two persons, typically at the first occurrence of these two persons in the discourse (see <span id="nuy">/nganja<u>l</u>-yij/</span> NMET <a href="../texts/NMETP-76.html#76-1">76.1.1/2</a> and MT 9). However, even when functioning effectively as a predicate, these forms do not function formally as NAdj and thus cannot take intransitive pronominal prefixes: *<span id="nuy">/wini=nganja<u>l</u>-yij/</span> 'They(MDu) are male avoidance relatives'. Instead, regular nominal form is used: <span id="nuy">/(na-)nganja<u>l</u>-yij/</span> '(they are) male avoidance relatives'.</p>
<p>The low text frequency of Dyadic forms reflects competition from functionally similar constructions. One, nowadays, is the borrowing of creole forms with Dyadic <span id="nuy">/-gija/</span> [<u>together</u>] like <span id="nuy">/<u>father</u>-gija/</span> 'Fa and Ch'; indeed, this suffix may replace <span id="nuy">/-yij/</span> as Dyadic suffix with Nunggubuyu kin terms: <span id="nuy">/na-nganja<u>l</u>-gija/</span> (NMET <a href="../texts/NMETP-76.html#76-1">76.1.2</a>). Second, in some narratives where two protagonists are introduced and their kinship relationship specified, this is done not by a single Dyadic form, rather by juxtaposing two PROP<sub>3</sub> linear kin terms. Thus in NMET <a href="../texts/NMETP-10.html#10-2">10.2.1</a> we find <span id="nuy">/ni-wiya-yung/</span> 'his So' and then <span id="nuy">/ni-nyara-yung/</span> 'his Fa' juxtaposed; a free English translation would be 'a boy and his Fa' (or 'a man and his So'), requiring that one referent be identified absolutely before the second can be identified relatively (i.e., by a kin term). In Nunggubuyu, it is usual to identify both referents by kin terms, even though this means that the first kin term will have a propositus which has not yet appeared in the discourse. A third, somewhat uncommon, functional alternative to Dyadic terms is the use of a Reciprocal form of a kin-term verb (§<a href="FGNP-5-12.html">5.12</a>, below), e.g., <span id="nuy">/wurru=murruyung-ga-nyji:-na/</span> 'They(MDu) call each other "Br"'.</p>
<p>The Pl Dyadic terms are even less common. As noted above, they require a minimum of three referents. Although there are several logical possibilities for such terms, in practise they are largely confined to cases like 'a father and his children' in which two or more persons are related in the same way to the same referent. It is conceivable that such a Pl Dyadic form might turn up in a more complex context of the type 'two or more men [of arbitrary kinship relationships to each other] and their respective children', but this is not the usual meaning and I have no such exx.</p>
