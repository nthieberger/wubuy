  <h1>3.27 Palatal-Deletion P-26.</h1>
<p>The consonants <span id = "nuy">/y j n<sup>y</sup>/</span> are deleted under certain conditions before other consonants, mainly coronal (alveolar, retroflexed, etc.). Such combinations as <span id = "nuy">/jj/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>n<sup>y</sup>/</span> will be reduced anyway by Geminate-Contraction <a href = "FGN-3-32.html">P-31</a>. However, <span id = "nuy">/j y n<sup>y</sup>/</span> are also deleted in some nongeminate clusters and a rule must be set up. It is possible, though, that this rule should be combined with yr-Contraction <a href = "FGN-3-15.html">P-14</a>.
<p>The laminoalveolar stop <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> is commonly deleted before coronal stops <span id = "nuy">/dh d <u>d</u>/</span>  The rule applies rigorously in established compounds and derivatives, but is sometimes suspended in newer, transparent combinations--particularly when a noun ending in <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> is followed by a case or postpositional suffix. Exx. of deletion: <span id = "nuy">//lhaj-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/lha-dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'short piece of wood'; <span id = "nuy">//mij-rigi-j//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/mi-digi-j/</span> 'mother and child dyad'; <span id = "nuy">//-ij=<u>r</u>agu-//</span> → <span id = "nuy">/-i=<u>d</u>agu-/</span> 'to forget (be looking for) word'. Deletion does not occur very often before <span id = "nuy">/b/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/g/</span>  except that deletion before these consonants is moderately common after <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> vowel, especially in Causative verb forms with suffix <span id = "nuy">/-jga-/</span> following <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  Exx. showing failure to delete <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> before <span id = "nuy">/b g/</span> are <span id = "nuy">/mij-bawa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> and variant <span id = "nuy">/mij-gawa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> 'father and child dyad'.</p>
<p>It is difficult to obtain a full set of exx. of underlying <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> followed by various consonants. However, we can cite <span id = "nuy">//ay-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur//</span> → <span id = "nuy">/a-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'short raft' with <span id = "nuy">//y//</span> disappearing before <span id = "nuy">/lh/</span>  We cannot cite any example involving the combination  <span id = "nuy">//ydh//</span>  In principle, we ought to be able to concoct a compound involving <span id = "nuy">//-ay-//</span> 'nest; raft' as compounding initial and some verb beginning in <span id = "nuy">//dh//</span> as compound final, but no exx. have materialised. It is reasonable to assume that they would undergo deletion of the <span id = "nuy">//y//</span> at least as an optional pronunciation. As for <span id = "nuy">//yr//</span>  simplification of this cluster to <span id = "nuy">/r/</span> is accounted for by rule <a href = "FGN-3-15.html">P-14</a> (yr-Contraction), see above.</p>
<p>There are some exx. showing deletion of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> before <span id = "nuy">/n/</span>  The available exx. involve underlying <span id = "nuy">//j-n//</span>  where presumably <span id = "nuy">//j//</span> → <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> by Nasalisation <a href = "FGN-3-23.html">P-22</a>. In any event, with Pl prefix <span id = "nuy">//mij-//</span> we get surface <span id = "nuy">/min<sup>y</sup>-/</span> before velar nasal in <span id = "nuy">/min<sup>y</sup>-n<sup>g</sup>a<u>l</u>an<sup>y</sup>ji/</span> 'girls', but just <span id = "nuy">/mi-/</span> in <span id = "nuy">/mi-ni-n<sup>y</sup>ara-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'his/her/their fathers' and other forms with following <span id = "nuy">/n/</span>  However, just as <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> is deleted before <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> preferentially when preceded by <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  this deletion of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> before <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> may be favoured by preceding <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  since deletion does not occur in <span id = "nuy">//-lhaj=na-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/-lhan<sup>y</sup>=na-/</span> 'to see (cut) wood', where the preceding vowel is <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  In short, the deletion appears to apply to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> following <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> and preceding <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> (presumably also <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>  though we have no exx.); it clearly does not apply to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> before velar <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  nor does it apply to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> before <span id = "nuy">/m/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">/-nin<sup>y</sup>-miri/</span> 'by means of (grass) roots'. We have no exx. involving underlying <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>y</sup>//</span> followed by the (rare) interdental nasal phoneme <span id = "nuy">/nh/</span>  the geminate cluster <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>y</sup>n<sup>y</sup>//</span> is handled by Geminate-Contraction <a href = "FGN-3-32.html">P-31</a>.</p>
<p>We attempt to summarise the deletions which we have just detailed as follows:</p>
