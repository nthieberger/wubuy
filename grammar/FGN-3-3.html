  <h1>3.3 Initial Reduplication P-2.</h1>
<p>We are here concerned with the primary reduplication rule, applying either at the beginning of the noun or verb root or, more regularly, at the beginning of the first morpheme following inflectional prefixes. This rule is most common with verbs (indicating repetition or prolongation) but occurs with some nouns (plural). Some roots, often having both verbal and nominal forms and with generally adjective-like meaning, are often reduplicated regardless of aspect or plurality. Details are covered in §4.14, §8.4, §13.5, §14.14-15. Many roots (flora-fauna nouns, for example) have no reduplications. A distinct reduplication affecting demonstrative pronouns is dealt with in the following section.</p>
<p>The point in the unreduplicated input where the reduplicative segment (-Rdp-) goes is determined by morphology. For verbs it is characteristically <span id = "double">immediately after the inflectional (pronominal) prefix</span>, and the segment reduplicated may therefore be the root or a preceding derivational/compounding element (except that epenthetic <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>u-/</span> from P-1 may not be at the beginning of the reduplication). In the case of the bisyllabic -Rdp- type (see below), the input segment may involve an internal morpheme-boundary. For example, in the input form <span id = "nuy">/CV-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>C3V3-/</span> where <span id = "nuy">/-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>=/</span> is a derivational or compounding element, the reduplication may be <span id = "nuy">/CV-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>- =C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>C3V3-/</span> (the initial <span id = "nuy">/CV-/</span> representing an inflectional prefix not considered in the reduplication). Similarly, if the input is <span id = "nuy">/CV=C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>/</span> with monosyllabic verb root <span id = "nuy">/=C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-/</span> and a following inflectional suffix, the latter may be included in the reduplication if the bisyllabic -Rdp- type is found, hence <span id = "nuy">/CV-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>/</span>  In some cases, reduplication applies at the beginning of the verb root and disregards earlier derivational/compounding elements; there are also a few cases (mostly in narrative/song style involving a specific set of stems) where both the root and an earlier derivational/compounding element are reduplicated. These types are lexically restricted. See "internal" and "double" redup. (§8.4).</p>
<p><span id = "double">The only suffixes which can constitute input are derivational and inflectional verbal suffixes</span> (mainly marking tense/aspect). Other suffixes (including all nominal suffixes) are not involved in the reduplication even when the preceding root is monosyllabic.</p>
<p>Basically, the form taken by the -Rdp- segment is as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>- if the input begins with a stop</td></tr>
<tr><td>-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>1</sub>- if the input begins with another	consonant</td></tr>
<tr><td>-V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>- if the input begins with a vowel</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Thus <span id = "nuy">/=bura-/</span> 'to sit' reduplicates as <span id = "nuy">/-bu=bura-/</span>; <span id = "nuy">/=lhan<sup>g</sup>arma-/</span> 'to reach, find' as <span id = "nuy">/-lhan<sup>g</sup>a=lhan<sup>g</sup>arma-/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/=agi-/</span> 'to fetch' as <span id = "nuy">//-aga=agi-//</span> (which then becomes <span id = "nuy">/-aga:='gi-/</span> by P-49). Note that in the bisyllabic types the vowel of the second syllable is <span id = "nuy">/V<sub>1</sub>/</span>  not <span id = "nuy">/V<sub>2</sub>/</span> as in the root; a further example is <span id = "nuy">/=ma-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> 'got' (including Past<sub>2</sub> suffix) becoming <span id = "nuy">/-man<sup>g</sup>a=ma-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> </p>
<p>Of the three types listed above, clearly the second and third are simply subtypes of a general bisyllabic type, the only difference between them being whether the input (and hence -Rdp-) has or lacks an initial consonant. The basic rule is thus: <span id = "double">monosyllabic -Rdp-before input beginning with stop, otherwise bisyllabic type</span>.</p>
<p>While the rule works fairly well as stated, there are some exceptions: a) monosyllabic inputs; b) cases of <span id = "nuy">/-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-/</span> instead of expected bisyllabic <span id = "nuy">/-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>-/</span>; c) special <span id = "nuy">/ C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-/</span> used with a few stems. We now discuss these in turn.</p>
<p>With <span id = "double">monosyllabic input</span>, not surprisingly we are limited to a monosyllabic -Rdp-. There are not many inputs that are this short. For nouns I can cite only <span id = "nuy">/yilg/</span> 'silly', rdp. <span id = "nuy">/yi-yilg/</span>  For verbs, we do have some monosyllabic roots which can take inflectional suffixes of the shape <span id = "nuy">/-Ø/</span> and/or <span id = "nuy">/-C/</span>  and since the input to reduplication ends with the inflectional suffix the inputs here are monosyllabic. The actual inputs are <span id = "nuy">/=C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>/</span> with short vowel and <span id = "nuy">/=C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>: -Ø/</span> with no final consonant but with long vowel. (In some cases the latter type is arguably derived from the earlier type, or from <span id = "nuy">//=C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-V<sub>2</sub>//</span>  but this need not worry us here.)</p>
<p>As I hear them, the rdp. forms from these inputs are as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=CV:/</span>/ becomes <span id = "nuy">>/CV:=CV:/</span> (morpheme boundary omitted)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=CVC/</span> becomes <span id = "nuy">/-CV=CVC/</span> (morpheme boundary omitted)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Examples of the first type are a handful of Nonpast<sub>3</sub> verb forms from <span id = "nuy">/=CV-/</span> verbs, with suffix <span id = "nuy">/-i/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/-u/</span> being absorbed by the root vowel by P-49. Thus <span id = "nuy">/=ni:-'/</span> 'will not see' becomes <span id = "nuy">/-ni:=ni:-'/</span> 'will never see', and <span id = "nuy">/=yu:-'/</span> 'will not give' forms <span id = "nuy">/-yu:=yu:-'/</span> </p>
<p>Examples of the second type involve Nonpast<sub>1</sub> forms in <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>y</sup>/</span>  and Past<sub>2</sub> forms with <span id = "nuy">/-y/</span>  added to monosyllabic verbs in certain inflectional classes. Examples are <span id = "nuy">/=na-n<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'will see' or 'does not see', rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-na=na-n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/=lha-y/</span> 'was standing', rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-lha=lha-y/</span></p> 
<p>I should add that since actual vowel-length contrasts do not occur in these contexts, and since phonetic vowel length is highly subject to intonational skewing, these transcriptions of length are impressionistic. Since Nonpast<sub>1</sub> and Nonpast<sub>3</sub> are infrequently reduplicated, the only common forms are the Past<sub>2</sub> ones, and here the suffix <span id = "nuy">/-y/</span> occurs only with two monosyllabic roots, <span id = "nuy">/=lha-/</span> 'to stand' and <span id = "nuy">/=yi-/</span> 'to sleep'.</p>
<p>We now consider cases of <span id = "nuy">/-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-/</span> reduplication for stems which should give bisyllabic, -Rdp- by the rules given above. Essentially what is going on here is that bisyllabic reduplications which would involve several identical or very similar syllables are simplified. For example, there are some roots which already happen to have <span id = "nuy">/C<sub>1</sub>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/C<sub>2</sub>/</span> identical (whether or not the vowels are also identical) , as in the cases of the adjectival noun <span id = "nuy">/mama<u>r</u>/</span> 'empty' and the verb <span id = "nuy">/=<u>l</u>a<u>l</u>a-/</span> 'to tear'. Expected reduplications  <span id = "nuy">/mama-mama<u>r</u>/</span> and  <span id = "nuy">/-<u>l</u>a<u>l</u>a=<u>l</u>a<u>l</u>a-/</span> with four consecutive identical <span id = "nuy">/CV/</span> sequences are in fact simplified to <span id = "nuy">/ma-mama<u>r</u>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/-<u>l</u>a=<u>l</u>a<u>l</u>a-/</span>  However, the form <span id = "nuy">/=na-ni/</span>  Past<sub>2</sub> of <span id = "nuy">/=na-/</span> 'to see', always reduplicates as <span id = "nuy">/-nana=na-ni/</span> with bisyllabic -Rdp-. It appears, then, that this particular alternation in reduplicative shapes may be lexically specific even though a phonological basis is detectable. (We could attempt to avoid this, suggesting that <span id = "nuy">/=na-ni/</span> behaves differently because its two vowels are different, or because of the internal morpheme boundary, but we do not have a large range of forms which might permit us to identify clearcut patterns of this type. A form <span id = "nuy">/-lhalha=lhalha<u>r</u>a-/</span>  rdp. of <span id = "nuy">/=lhalha<u>r</u>a-/</span> 'to fall out', was obtained in an elicitation session, and if valid this clearly shows lexically based variation.)</p>
<p>There are a few other cases of <span id = "nuy">/-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-/</span> for expected bisyllabic -Rdp-. These include <span id = "nuy">/=<u>l</u>u:lha-/</span> 'to wade', rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-<u>l</u>u=<u>l</u>u:lha-/</span>  where <span id = "nuy">/C<sub>1</sub>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/C<sub>2</sub>/</span> are distinct but both laterals, and two important verbs beginning in <span id = "nuy">/ma/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/=ma:<u>n</u>dha-/</span> 'to make' and rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-ma=ma:<u>n</u>dha-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/=ma:jga-/</span> 'to make' and rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-ma=ma:jga-/</span>  (Vowel length in root may be a factor here, but many other verbs with long vowel in first syllable behave normally in reduplication.)</p>
<p>A special <span id = "nuy">/-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-/</span> reduplication is used for a small number of roots whose simple form already appears in what looks like a reduplication of this same syllabic shape. Exx. are <span id = "nuy">/=gujguji-/</span> 'to hold up', rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-guj=gujguji-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/=bilwila-/</span> 'to be weak', rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-bil=wilwila-/</span>  Others can be gleaned from §14.5.</p>
<p>This pattern is restricted lexically as well as phonologically, and some former reduplications of this type are being reinterpreted as separate roots. Thus <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>uldha-/</span> 'to cut, sever' (*-gulk-dhu-) and <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>ulguldha-/</span> 'to cut up (wood, etc.)' (*-gulk-gulk-dhu-) are now essentially independent of each other but were once related as simplex to reduplication (the reconstructed forms still occur as such in Ngandi). They now each have their own synchronic reduplication, <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>uldhu=wuldha-/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>ulgu=wulguldha-/</span>  respectively, and note that the latter shows full bisyllabic reduplication.</p>
<p>We have discussed vowel length in the monosyllabic-root reduplications (preceding page, top), but not for the nonmonosyllables. When the reduplicative segment itself is monosyllabic, its own vowel is clearly short in all cases, while the root retains the same vowel length it has in the simplex: <span id = "nuy">/-<u>l</u>u=<u>l</u>u:lha-/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/=<u>l</u>u:lha-/</span> to wade'; <span id = "nuy">/-bu=bu:la-/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/=bu:la-/</span> 'to be smoking'; <span id = "nuy">/-ju=ju<u>r</u>a-/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/=ju<u>r</u>a-/</span> 'to push'. When the -Rdp- segment is bisyllabic, both of its vowels are always short, and if the root has <span id = "nuy">/V<sub>1</sub>/</span> long this is shortened (subsequent vowels are not affected). Thus from <span id = "nuy">/=ya:-ri:/</span> 'goes' we have rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-yara=ya-ri:/</span>  and from <span id = "nuy">/=yu<u>r</u>i:-’/</span> transports' we have rdp. <span id = "nuy">/-yu<u>r</u>u=yu<u>r</u>i:-'/</span>  When the root starts with a vowel the same pattern can be presumed, but later rules (P-49) eventually combine adjacent vowels into new long vowels. Thus both <span id = "nuy">/=a:gi-/</span> to return' and <span id = "nuy">/=agi-/</span> 'to fetch' have reduplications which can be represented as underlying <span id = "nuy">//-aga=agi-//</span>  surface <span id = "nuy">/-aga:='gi-/</span> (and with the first vowel in the -Rdp- segment usually combining with the final vowel of the prefix to form another long surface vowel).</p>
<p>A few remarks concerning nominal reduplication are appropriate here. In general, the formal pattern is the same as already seen with (mostly) verbal examples. As far as the point where -Rdp- begins, we should note the following. To a greater extent than verbs, <span id = "double">nouns tend to disregard compounding initials and derivational prefixes</span> (aside from noun-class prefixes) and begin the -Rdp- with the root. This is particularly true of high-frequency, sometimes irregular, plural reduplications of certain adjectival nouns such as <span id = "nuy">/dhama-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'short', <span id = "nuy">/ala:-'la:di/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/ala:di/</span> 'bad', and irregular <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>ura:yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>irig/</span> 'small'. Thus pattern carries over to predicative uses (with verbal prefixes), hence <span id = "nuy">/wu-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a=dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'the tree  <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>ag/</span>  is short', plural <span id = "nuy">/wu-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a-dhama=lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'the trees are short', not  <span id = "nuy">/wu-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a-ran<sup>g</sup>a=dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span>  (However, double rdp. <span id = "nuy">/wu-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a- -dhama=lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> is possible.)</p>
<p>The major exception is that the derivational noun-class prefixes are included in the reduplication. Since reduplication in this context is possible only for semantically human nouns, only human plural derivational prefix <span id = "nuy">/-uG-/</span> is affected, and only a few stems are involved (since most roots which take derivational noun-class prefixes are strictly nonhuman). Thus from <span id = "nuy">/uG-muwaj/</span> 'name(d)' (syntactically a noun) we get human plural <span id = "nuy">/uGmu-uG-muwaj/</span>  surface <span id = "nuy">/-umu:-'-muwaj/</span>  Similarly, Gentilic prefix <span id = "nuy">/nuN-/</span> is included in reduplications, as in <span id = "nuy">/nun<sup>y</sup>ju-nun<sup>y</sup>-jul/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/nun<sup>y</sup>-jul/</span> bush (inland) person'.</p>
<p>In reading texts, the major difficulty in recognising and analysing reduplications is that the underlying form may be obscured by later rules, most notably VV-Contraction P-49. Suppose we find a form <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>awa:ra:ru:/</span> 'I kept leaving it (behind)'. To clarify the structure we first retranscribe it with punctuation as <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>awa:-'ra:='ru:/</span> following the system used in my earlier publications. Here / ' / indicates elision of morpheme-initial vowel.</p>
<p>It is now easier to see the underlying structure <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>awu-ara=aru-u//</span> (the root being actually <span id = "nuy">/=a:ru-/</span> . As another example, consider two forms <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ani:na:nani/</span> 'he saw (it) for me' and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>aninananani/</span> 'he kept seeing me'. The latter is straightforwardly <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ani-nana=na-ni/</span>  but the former is less simple. By first rewriting it as <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ani:na:-'=na-ni/</span> we can see that the input form differs from the input to the other form in having Benefactive prefix <span id = "nuy">/-aG-/</span> just before the verb root, hence <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>ani-Rdp-aG=na-ni//</span>  The underlying form of the reduplication is thus <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>ani-aGna-aG=na-ni//</span>  which ends up as <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ani:-'na:-'=na-ni/</span>  Readers working through my texts will find that the punctuation helps clarify word structure, but those transcribing new material or working through texts lacking such punctuation may sometimes find it difficult to identify and correctly analyse some reduplications.</p>
<p>We summarise the formulation of the rule as follows:</p>
<a name = "P-2" /><table>
<tr><td>(P-2) Initial Reduplication</tr></td>
<tr><td>Rdp &#8594; C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>:- // ______-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>#</tr></td>
<tr><td>C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>- // ___-C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>1</sub>aV<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub></tr></td>
<tr><td>for certain roots, where C<sub>1</sub>a is identical to C<sub>1</sub> or in morphophonemic alternation (stop/continuant) with it</tr></td>
<tr><td>C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>1</sub> // ______C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>(:) C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(:)</tr></td>
<tr><td>where is a consonant other than a stop and C<sub>2</sub> is any consonant or consonant cluster (this part of the rule fails to apply to certain lexically marked roots, mostly with C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> identical)</tr></td>
<tr><td>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>2</sub>- // _____-V<sub>1</sub>(:)C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(:)</tr></td>
<tr><td>where C<sub>1</sub> is any consonant or consonant cluster</tr></td>
<tr><td>C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> - // elsewhere (i.e., for monosyllables of type -C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>#, for all roots beginning with stops, and for lexically marked roots which fail to take bisyllabic -Rdp-</tr></td>
<tr><td>Note: In this rule # represents a word boundary or potential word boundary (end of noun stem; end of inflected verb form including tense/aspect suffix but no other suffixes). Location of -Rdp- is either at beginning of root or at beginning of first segment following inflectional prefix.</tr></td>
