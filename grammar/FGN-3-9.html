  <h1>3.9 Velar-Insertion P-8.</h1>
<p>This rule inserts <span id = "nuy">/g/</span>  and in a few instances <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  at the beginning of a morpheme normally beginning with vowel, after a morpheme which ends in a stop or nasal. It should be noted that another rule P-20, Pronominal d-Insertion, is a competing rule which applies in a similar (though distinct) environment. P-20 applies when the preceding morpheme is a pronominal prefix ending in <span id = "nuy">/n/</span>  there is a variant P-21 applying to the Pl moiety term <span id = "nuy">/mand-irija/</span>  This leaves Velar-Insertion P-8 to apply in all remaining combinations where the preceding morpheme is a derivational prefix or compound initial ending in a stop or nasal.</p>
<p>For example, consider <span id = "nuy">/=abi-/</span> 'to jump'. With pronominal prefix <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an- /</span> '1Sg<sub>b</sub>b' we get <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>and=a:bi-n<sup>y</sup>/</span> by P-20, which inserts <span id = "nuy">/d/</span> and also lengthens the root-initial vowel. On the other hand, with derivational prefix <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>ara<u>n</u>-, -n<sup>g</sup>araG-/</span> 'Multiple' (ยง10.4) we get <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>ara<u>n</u>=gabi-/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>ara=gabi-/</span>  It is suggested that Velar-Insertion P-8 is involved in the latter forms.</p>
<p>The morpheme before which the velar consonant is inserted can begin with <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/a:/</span>  or <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  There are no exx. involving <span id = "nuy">/i:/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/u/</span>  or <span id = "nuy">/u:/</span>  but this is simply because the relevant underlying combinations do not occur. Similarly, the insertion normally applies at the beginning of a root or a preceding derivational/compounding element, not at the root-suffix boundary, but again this appears to be due to nonoccurrence of relevant underlying combinations. Exx. involving Benefactive <span id = "nuy">/-aG-/</span> (where <span id = "nuy">/G/</span> is a stop archiphoneme) are <span id = "nuy">/-a=gabi-/</span> 'to jump for', <span id = "nuy">/-a=ga:ru-/</span> 'to leave for', and <span id = "nuy">/-a=gin<sup>y</sup>ga-/</span> 'to complete for' from <span id = "nuy">/=abi-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/=a:ru-/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/=in<sup>y</sup>ga-/</span>  Here the <span id = "nuy">/G/</span> triggers Velar-Insertion (then disappears by Stop-Deletion P-29).</p> 
<p>The velar consonant which gets inserted is always <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> when the preceding morpheme ends in a stop (whether or not the stop itself subsequently disappears). Exx. are <span id = "nuy">/-mij=gajarga-/</span> 'to get (name) wrong' from <span id = "nuy">/=ajarga-/</span> 'to miss', and <span id = "nuy">/lhamij-gala:di/</span> 'bad-tasting' from <span id = "nuy">/ala:di/</span> 'bad'. With a preceding morpheme ending in a nasal, the situation is more complex. Available exx. involving <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> show insertion of <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> in all cases; available exx. involving <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> show insertion of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> in most cases but sometimes of <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> (in the case of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> inserted after <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> the insertion has no surface effect because of subsequent simplification by Geminate-Contraction P-31). Exx. with <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> following <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> are <span id = "nuy">/-<u>l</u>an=n<sup>g</sup>adada-/</span> 'to have knees sticking out of water' from <span id = "nuy">/=adada-/</span> 'to go up on shore'; <span id = "nuy">/mun-n<sup>g</sup>ala:di/</span> 'having bad foot/feet' from <span id = "nuy">/ala:di/</span> 'bad'; and perhaps <span id = "nuy">/-<u>r</u>aman=n<sup>g</sup>ala-/</span> 'to be decorated with <u>r</u>aman feathers' if derived from <span id = "nuy">/=ala-/</span>  Exx. involving (vacuous) insertion of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  subsequently deleted, after <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> are: <span id = "nuy">/-ma<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>=a<u>nd</u>arma-/</span> 'to shake hand' from <span id = "nuy">/=a<u>nd</u>arma-/</span> 'to shake'; and <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>un<sup>g</sup>-ala:di/</span> 'badly behaved' from <span id = "nuy">/ala:di/</span> 'bad'. Exx. showing insertion of <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> after a nasal are: <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>uln<sup>g</sup>=gabi-/</span> '(animal) to move out' if from <span id = "nuy">/=abi-/</span> 'to jump' (initial segment not found elsewhere); <span id = "nuy">/-mun=gala-/</span> 'to leave tracks behind' from <span id = "nuy">/=ala-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/-malan<sup>y</sup>=gala-/</span> 'to have fins visible' also from <span id = "nuy">/=ala-/</span>  recall also <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>a<u>r</u>an=gabi-/</span> from preceding page.</p>
<p>Instead of a rule inserting <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> directly, we could also consider an alternative analysis involving insertion of presurface <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span>  which will then automatically become surface <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> after stop or nasal by Hardening P-18. This approach is not used here, since the underlying vowel-initial roots which get <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> by Velar-Insertion also regularly (though not always) get <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> after <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  The other roots with initial underlying <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>V/</span> never show the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> becoming <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  after all nasals (and stops) the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> becomes <span id = "nuy">/g/</span>  Therefore the alternative to the present analysis (with Velar-Insertion) would require insertion of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> in precisely those cases where this becomes surface <span id = "nuy">/g/</span>  and we would still need a separate rule inserting <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span></p>
