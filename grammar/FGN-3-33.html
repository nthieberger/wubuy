  <h1>3.33 lh-Delateralisation P-32.</h1>
<p>Ordinarily, interdental /lh/ is a stable phoneme in the positions where it is permitted, except that it becomes /dh/ after stop or nasal by Hardening <a href = "FGN-3-19.html">P-18</a>. However, in one verb paradigm it appears to alternate with /y/ in some forms. This is /<span id = "nuy">=bilya-</span>/ 'to be tilted'. In the Past<sub>2</sub>, I recorded /<span id = "nuy">=bilya-y</span>/ and /<span id = "nuy">=billhi-Ã˜</span>/, where in addition to the alternation of /y/ and /lh/ we also have an alternation between /ay/ and /i/. Here it would appear that the /i/ variant involves optional application of V-Fronting <a href = "FGN-3-51.html">P-50</a> to //iy//, then shortened to /i/ syllable- and word-finally by iy-Contraction <a href = "FGN-3-16.html">P-15</a>.</p>
<p>While the alternation of /ay/ with /i/ is not unusual, that of /y/ and /lh/ is. For speakers who have the forms as just listed, I incline to posit underlying //lh// becoming /y/ when followed (on the surface) by /a/, but kept as /lh/ when followed by /i/ (for the full paradigm see Table 11-5) N<sup>g</sup>A<sub>2</sub> paradigm).</p>
<table>
<tr><td>(P-32)	lh-Delateralisation</td></tr>
<tr><td>1h		&#8594; y // __a</td></tr>
<tr><td>in the stem /<span id = "nuy">-billha-</span>/ 'to be tilted'</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It is also possible to posit underlying //y// becoming /lh/ before /i/. In neither formulation would the rule be generalisable to other forms in the language. Elsewhere /<span id = "nuy">llha</span>/ and /<span id = "nuy">lyi</span>/ are acceptable sequences, as in /<span id = "nuy">=w<sub>2</sub>allhi-&#216;</span>/, Nonpast3 of /<span id = "nuy">=w<sub>2</sub>allha-</span>/ 'to float', and /<span id = "nuy">a-n<sup>g</sup>ajal-(y)in<sup>y</sup>un<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'of the (water) spring'.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to think that /<span id = "nuy">=billha-</span>/ has been affected historically by analogies from the two other verbs with identical or near-identical suffixal paradigms, /<span id = "nuy">=lha-</span>/ 'to stand' and /<span id = "nuy">=yi-</span>/ 'to sleep'. It is possible that /<span id = "nuy">=billha-</span>/ is historically a compound of one, but has been influenced by the other as well. For some speakers the stem is /<span id = "nuy">=bil-yi-</span>/ with exactly the same paradigm as /<span id = "nuy">=yi-</span>/ 'to sleep' and can thus be considered to be a synchronic auxiliary compound of it.</p>
