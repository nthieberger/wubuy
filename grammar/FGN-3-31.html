  <h1>3.31 Nasal-Deletion P-30.</h1>
<p>Velar nasal <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> and nasal archiphoneme <span id = "nuy">/N/</span> (which can be regarded as <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  are deleted before another nasal consonant. Pronominal prefixes ending in the B morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span>  where the evidence for positing underlying alveolar <span id = "nuy">//n//</span> is somewhat indirect and tenuous, show the same treatment before a nasal. There is also reason to believe that these nasals are deleted before (surface) liquids, though not all relevant underlying combinations can be cited in the data.</p>
<p>Exx. involving <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> are <span id = "nuy">/wulan<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'blood' in case form <span id = "nuy">/wula-miri/</span> 'by means of blood', and some compounds of <span id = "nuy">/=na-/</span> 'to see' like <span id = "nuy">/-dhalama=na-/</span> 'to see broken-off branch' with <span id = "nuy">/-dhamalan<sup>g</sup>-/</span>  There are no consistent counterexx. at boundaries, though in artificially slow and careful speech the <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> is sometimes heard.</p>
<p>Inverse morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-N-/</span>  a component of many transitive pronominal prefixes, is deleted before other nasals; the available exx. involve following <span id = "nuy">/m/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/n/</span>  Thus MANA→ 1Sg<sub>a</sub> <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-N-ma-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ama-/</span> with no surface effect of the <span id = "nuy">//-N-//</span> morpheme, so this is homophonous with 1Sg→ MANAa <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-ma-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ama-/</span>.</p>
<p>Pronominal prefixes ending in B morpheme <span id = "nuy">//-w<sub>2</sub>an-//</span> behave like morphemes with final <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>//</span> or archiphoneme <span id = "nuy">//N//</span> in connectionwith Nasal-Assimilation <a href = "FGN-3-28.html">P-27</a>, and also behave like morphemes ending in these nasals in the present deletion rule. Thus <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>an=n<sup>g</sup>u-yi://</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=n<sup>g</sup>u-yi:/</span> 'I will eat it', where <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>an-//</span> itself is analysable as <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-w<sub>2</sub>an-//</span> with the B morpheme on a more abstract analysis. However, in other cases morpheme-final <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> remains as such before another nasal, as in <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>a:n-miri/</span> 'by means of a vine sp.' and in compound <span id = "nuy">/-mun=n<sup>g</sup>aln<sup>g</sup>ala-/</span> 'to have foot shining'.</p>
<p>There are not a great many attested combinations of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/N/</span>  or <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> before a (surface) liquid. This is because a following <span id = "nuy">/lh/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>/</span>  or (in most cases) <span id = "nuy">/r/</span> will undergo Hardening <a href = "FGN-3-19.html">P-18</a> after a nasal, so we end up with a nasal-stop sequence. However, there are a few combinations in which <span id = "nuy">/r/</span> escapes Hardening, and there are also some combinations with following <span id = "nuy">/1/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/<u>1</u>/</span>  the two liquids which have no Hardening counterpart. In the available combinations, the preceding <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/N/</span>  or <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> is deleted, at least in the most common pronunciation. Indeed, deletion of the nasal in this environment may apply even more generally than before another nasal, since <span id = "nuy">/-man-/</span> (a Pl derivational prefix or compound initial) normally keeps its <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> before another nasal but seems to drop it in the usual pronunciation of compound <span id = "nuy">/-ma(n)=<u>l</u>u:lha-/</span> 'to wade as a group'. An ex. with <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> is <span id = "nuy">/-ya=<u>l</u>a<u>l</u>aga-/</span> 'to make (it) louder' with compound initial related to <span id = "nuy">/ya:n<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'voice, sound'.</p>
<p>As noted above, ordinarily morpheme-final <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> is not deleted before another nasal. Likewise, <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> is often retained before another nasal; for a more restricted deletion rule in some preconsonantal environments see Palatal-Deletion <a href = "FGN-3-27.html">P-26</a>. Nasals <span id = "nuy">/nh/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/m/</span> do not occur in any relevant underlying combination, so we have no evidence for or against their deletability before another nasal. The remaining nasal, retroflexed <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>  is stable before other nasals.</p>
<p>The following is an attempt to summarise the facts.</p>
<table>

<tr><td colspan = "5">where <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span> is the B morpheme in a pronominal prefix</td></tr>
</table>
<p>For some of the combinations, if not all, we could also consider an analysis in which the nasal is assimilated in all features to the following nasal or lateral, and then deleted by Geminate-Contraction <a href = "FGN-3-32.html">P-31</a>, to which we now turn.</p>
