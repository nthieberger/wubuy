  <h1>3.25 rn-Contraction P-24.</h1>
<p>The combination <span id = "nuy">/rn/</span> (with tap <span id = "nuy">/r/</span>  is not common at any level of derivations. In relatively productive compounds and the like, when morpheme-final <span id = "nuy">/r/</span> comes into contact with following morpheme-initial <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> the sequence may be retained: <span id = "nuy">/-rajbur=na-/</span> 'to mock' (compound with <span id = "nuy">/=na-/</span> 'to see').</p>
<p>However, in some of the more frozen combinations we appear to have a rule by which <span id = "nuy">/rn/</span> is converted into <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>  First, in demonstrative (including interrogative) pronouns, we find a MDu ending <span id = "nuy">/-<u>n</u>i/</span> in opposition to a FDu form <span id = "nuy">/-r-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wi-<u>n</u>i/</span> 'here they (MDu) are' vs. <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wi-r-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> 'here they (FDu) are' (Table 7-1, Chapter 7). Similar endings occur with independent personal pronouns (Table 6-1, Chapter 6). The M morpheme elsewhere shows up as <span id = "nuy">/na-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/ni-/</span>  or <span id = "nuy">/nu-/</span> depending on the particular context (inflectional vs. derivational noun-class prefix, intransitive vs. transitive pronominal prefix, etc.), opposed to F morpheme <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara- /</span>  <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>i-/</span>  or <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>u-/</span>  It seems reasonable, on a fairly abstract analysis, to represent <span id = "nuy">/-r-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> as consisting of a special Nonsingular morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-r-/</span>  related to Nonsingular <span id = "nuy">/-rV-/</span> in pronominal prefixes; by analogy, we could take MDu <span id = "nuy">/-<u>n</u>i/</span> as surface form of a sequence <span id = "nuy">//-r-ni//</span> with Nonsg <span id = "nuy">/-r-/</span> and M <span id = "nuy">/-ni/</span>  If so, we need a rule by which <span id = "nuy">//rn//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>.</p> 
<p>The other instance of this rule is now even more frozen. There is a verb <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u-<u>n</u>a-/</span> 'to make large campfire', which has the same (very unusual) suffixal paradigm as <span id = "nuy">/=na-/</span> 'to burn' (trans.), and which can thus be regarded as a compound thereof. It is quite possible that the compound initial is historically identical to <span id = "nuy">/wurg/</span> 'bushfire or grass fire', although synchronically this relationship is at best opaque. (The <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> of <span id = "nuy">/wurg/</span> seems to be <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> rather than <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> to judge by the verb <span id = "nuy">/=agurgan<sup>y</sup>ji-/</span> 'to set fires in bush', which seems to be from  <span id = "nuy">/-aG=w<sub>1</sub>urg-ga-n<sup>y</sup>ji-/</span>  In any event, if <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u=<u>n</u>a-/</span> is indeed to be treated as a compound of <span id = "nuy">/=na-/</span>  we probably need a rule of the type <span id = "nuy">//rn//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>.</p>
<table>
<tr><td rowspan = "3" valign = "top">(P-24)</td><td>rn-Contraction</td></tr>
<tr><td>rn &#8594; <u>n</u></td></tr>
<tr><td>in the combination of Nonsg <span id = "nuy">/-r-/</span> with M <span id = "nuy">/-ni/</span>  and in the compound <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u=na-/</span> from <span id = "nuy">//-w<sub>2</sub>urg=na-//</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>There is also a compound <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u=<u>n</u>agi-/</span> '(fire in oven) to be burning well', related to <span id = "nuy">/=nagi-/</span> 'to burn' (intrans.). Essentially, <span id = "nuy">/=nagi-/</span> functions as an irregular intransitivised (mediopassive) of <span id = "nuy">/=na-/</span> 'to burn' (trans.). It is thus not surprising that <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u=<u>n</u>a-/</span> has a counterpart <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u=<u>n</u>agi-/</span>  both showing P-24. However, both <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u=<u>n</u>a-/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>u=<u>n</u>agi-/</span> are intransitive, and they are not semantically related in precisely the same way the uncompounded stems are.</p>
