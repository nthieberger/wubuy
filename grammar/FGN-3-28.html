  <h1>3.28 Nasal-Assimilation P-27.</h1>
<p>The velar nasal <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> normally assimilates to the point of articulation of a following stop; exceptions are largely limited to artificially slow speech. Thus <span id = "nuy">/gulmun<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'belly' has case forms like Locative <span id = "nuy">/ama-gulmun-duj/</span>  Pergressive <span id = "nuy">/ama-gulmum-baj/</span>  and Relative <span id = "nuy">/ama-gulmun<sup>y</sup>-jin<sup>y</sup>un<sup>g</sup>/</span>  In the case of following <span id = "nuy">/j/</span>  we sometimes get <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> instead of fully assimilated <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span>  hence a variant Relative <span id = "nuy">/ama-gulmun-jin<sup>y</sup>un<sup>g</sup>/</span>.</p>
<p>A few prefixes and compound initials end in a nasal which behaves like <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  Since it occurs only in environments where it acquires surface point of articulation by assimilation, we represent it conservatively as an archiphoneme <span id = "nuy">/N/</span>  though setting it up more concretely as <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>//</span> would produce the right outputs. An ex. is Inverse <span id = "nuy">//-N-//</span>  a morpheme occurring within pronominal prefixes, as in ANA&#8594;1Sg<sub>a</sub> prefix <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-N-w<sub>1</sub>u- //</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an<sup>g</sup>gu-/</span>.</p>
<p>Our reluctance to set this up specifically as <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>//</span> is due to the fact that in some prefixes what appears to be final <span id = "nuy">//n//</span> also undergoes point-of-articulation assimilation. Thus what we call the B morpheme in pronominal prefixes, representable as <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span> under a maximally abstract analysis, does show assimilation. For example, 1Sg<sub>b</sub> <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-w<sub>2</sub>an-//</span> appears as <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>an-//</span>  and undergoes assimilation in combinations like <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>am=bann<sup>g</sup>a-na/</span> 'I will dance' and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an<sup>g</sup>-ga(u>l</u>=n<sup>g</sup>u-yi:/</span> 'I will drink'. (The evidence for transcribing the underlying form with <span id = "nuy">/n/</span>  rather than <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> or archiphoneme <span id = "nuy">/N/</span>  is indirect but is related to the rule for Pronominal d-Insertion <a href = "FGN-3-21.html">P-20</a>.)</p>
<p>In other morphemes, final <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> is stable on the surface, avoiding assimilation. Thus <span id = "nuy">/man-/</span> 'group', a derivational prefix, occurs in combinations like <span id = "nuy">/-man=bayama-/</span> '(group) to keep going', and <span id = "nuy">/da:n/</span> 'guts' in its compound-initial form <span id = "nuy">/-dan-/</span> retains its <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> in <span id = "nuy">/-dan-gara=gayi-'-/</span> 'to have a bellyache'. The same pattern is seen at the boundary between a noun and following case suffix, as in <span id = "nuy">/a-mu:n-baj/</span> 'by foot'.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that the rule applies to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> as a regular process, but to <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> only in pronominal prefixes in which B morpheme <span id = "nuy">//-w<sub>2</sub>an-//</span> is involved. The rule does not apply to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span>  which retains its laminoalveolar point of articulation with a following stop. The same is true of <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>  There is no evidence one way or the other for <span id = "nuy">/m/</span>  which does not occur in any relevant underlying combination.</p>

<p>Actually, the rule is slightly oversimplified as stated. We have mentioned that, in part (a) of the rule, we can get <span id = "nuy">/nj/</span> as a variant of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>j/</span> when <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> follows the nasal. In addition, when the stop is <span id = "nuy">/dh/</span> the output is what we write as <span id = "nuy">/ndh/</span>  rather than  <span id = "nuy">/nhdh/</span>  There is no opposition between <span id = "nuy">/ndh/</span> and  <span id = "nuy">/nhdh/</span>  since the latter does not occur, consistent with the general principle that interdentals do not occur syllable-finally, but the sound we hear in <span id = "nuy">/ndh/</span> is <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> rather than <span id = "nuy">/nh/</span>.</p>
