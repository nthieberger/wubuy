  <h1>3.5 Homorganic Semivowel-Deletion P-4.</h1>
<p>This is an interesting but minor morphophonemic rule applying to certain forms of <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>u-/</span> 'to hit, kill' and <span id = "nuy">/=yi-, =u-/</span> 'to give'. The initial semivowel is deleted when followed on the surface by a short homorganic vowel. Inflected forms in which the surface root vowel has been changed by one rule or other are unaffected; in addition, long-vowel forms are not affected.</p>
<p>The basic inflected forms of 'to hit, kill' can be represented as Past<sub>1</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>a-n<sup>g</sup>/</span>  Past<sub>2</sub>/=w<sub>2</sub>i-ni/, Nonpast<sub>1</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>i-n<sup>y</sup>/</span>  Nonpast<sub>2</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=u-ma-na/</span>  Nonpast<sub>3</sub> <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>u:-'/</span>  and Evitative <span id = "nuy">/=u-ma-n<sup>g</sup>un/</span>  It appears that <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>u-/</span> is the most basic form but that when the <span id = "nuy">/u/</span> is not lengthened or altered in quality the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is deleted (Nonpast<sub>2</sub> and Evitative). See Table 11-6, MA<sub>1</sub> type.</p>
<p>The deletion of the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is manifested on the surface in various ways. Specifically, VV-Contraction P-49 commonly applies to the output, since the inflected forms shown above are usually preceded by prefixes ending in a vowel: <span id = "nuy">//wara=w<sub>2</sub>u-ma-na//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">//wara=u-ma-na//</span> (P-4) &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/waru: = '-ma-na/</span> 'they kill them', where without P-4 we would have gotten output  <span id = "nuy">/wara=wu-ma-na/</span>  Similarly, Pronominal d-Insertion P-20 applies only to vowel-initial verb stems when preceded by pronominal prefixes ending in <span id = "nuy">/n/</span>  and P-20 does apply here: <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>an=w<sub>2</sub>u-ma-na//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>an=u-ma-na//</span> P-4)&#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>and=u:-ma-na/</span> 'I will kill it (ANA<sub>&#248;</sub>)'. Without P-4 we would have gotten incorrect  <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>am=bu-ma-na/</span> </p>
<p>The root <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>u-/</span> happens to be suppleted by <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>adja-/</span> in its ordinary compounds and most other derivatives. It does, however, form Benefactive <span id = "nuy">/-a=bu-/</span> from <span id = "nuy">//-aG=w<sub>2</sub>u-//</span>  showing retention of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> (surface <span id = "nuy">/b/</span>  in all forms, e.g., Nonpast<sub>2</sub> <span id = "nuy">/a=bu-ma-na/</span>  Other than this, <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>u-/</span> occurs (usually without its basic meaning) in a number of 'auxiliary' compounds in which the preceding element determines the sense, as in <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>arga<u>d</u>-bu-/</span> 'to belch' and <span id = "nuy">/=<u>r</u>a-wu-/</span> 'to test, try out' (in such forms the = boundary is shown before the nuclear element). When the nuclear element in the auxiliary compound ends in a nonnasal sonorant (liquid, conceivably semivowel), the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is often not heard when followed by homorganic vowel, as in Nonpast<sub>2</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=lhilhir-(w<sub>2</sub>) u-ma-na/</span> 'passes by', but this optional omission seems to be due to a low-level rule (see P-28, below) distinct from the specialised morphophonemic rule under consideration here. It does not appear that the latter operates in these auxiliary compounds.</p>
<p>The other verb, <span id = "nuy">/=yi-, =u-/</span> 'to give' presents additional difficulties, and it is unclear how many underlying stem-variants must be posited and what they should be. (The immediate historical prototype, incidentally, is *-wo-.) See Table 11-7.</p>
<p>In compounds there is evidence pointing toward <span id = "nuy">/=u-/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>u-/</span> as basic form. In <span id = "nuy">/-ma<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>=u-/</span> 'to hand over, give by hand' we must take <span id = "nuy">/=u-/</span> as basic, since underlying <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> following a nasal would have been hardened to <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> by Hardening P-18. Past<sub>1</sub> <span id = "nuy">/-ma<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>=a-n<sup>y</sup>/</span> shows that the <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> is not clearly present even when the root vowel is changed to a nonhomorganic quality. However, in <span id = "nuy">/-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>ga=wu-/</span> 'to give at night' we do seem to have <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>u-/</span> since no VV-Contraction P-49 occurs over the = boundary. There are a few other attested compounds and derivatives but they mostly end in stops or nonvelar nasals, and in this environment the surface form, <span id = "nuy">/=gu-/</span>  could reflect either underlying <span id = "nuy">//=w<sub>1</sub>u-//</span> by Hardening P-18 or underlying <span id = "nuy">//=u-//</span> via Velar Insertion P-8. An ex. is <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>ara<u>n</u>=gu-/</span> '(all) to give', Nonpast<sub>1</sub> <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>ara<u>n</u>=ga-n<sup>y</sup>/</span> </p>  
<p>In forms not involving a compound initial or a derivational prefix, 'to give' has forms pointing to <span id = "nuy">/=yV-/</span>  with the semivowel deleted when the vowel is surface <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  hence Past<sub>1</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=ya-n<sup>y</sup>/</span>  Past<sub>2</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=i-ni/</span>  Nonpast<sub>3</sub> <span id = "nuy">/=yu:-'/</span>  etc. We will use <span id = "nuy">/=yi-/</span> as the citation form and presumed underlying form, with P-4 deleting the <span id = "nuy">//y//</span> in the relevant forms.</p>
<p>The deletion rule, however, does not apply to Reciprocal form <span id = "nuy">/=yi-n<sup>y</sup>ji-/</span> 'to give to each other, to share'. Thus note absence of VV-Contraction P-49 in <span id = "nuy">/wuru=yi-n<sup>y</sup>ji:-na/</span> 'they are sharing' versus application of this rule in nonreciprocal <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>anu=yi-ni//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>anu=i-ni//</span> (P-4) <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>anu:='-ni/</span> (P-49) 'I gave (it) to him'.</p>
<p>Summing up the verbal exx., we can say that <span id = "nuy">//y//</span> and <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>2</sub>//</span> are deleted in basic inflected forms of 'to give' and 'to hit, kill' when followed by a short homorganic vowel; forms of 'to give' with compound initial or derivational prefix appear to show some variation between <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>u-/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/=u-/</span>  but under different conditions (which are, moreover, partly indeterminate due to alternative base forms for some combinations).</p>
<p>We also mention here a few instances of similar deletions of root-initial semivowels in noun morphology. As in the case of the verbs, deletion is sharply restricted lexically. The nominal exx. involve forms of the moiety term <span id = "nuy">/(y)irija/</span> </p>
<p>The unprefixed form <span id = "nuy">/yirija/</span> is ambiguous since underlying <span id = "nuy">//yirija//</span> or <span id = "nuy">//irija//</span> would turn out like this (see P-5, below). As predicate adjectival noun with intransitive pronominal prefixes, the form is clearly <span id = "nuy">/yirija/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=yirija/</span> 'I am Yirija' and <span id = "nuy">/ni=yirija/</span> 'He is Yirija' (i.e., of Yirija moiety). The same is true of most nominal forms with (inflectional) noun-class prefixes: <span id = "nuy">/na-yirija-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'Yirija man', <span id = "nuy">/mana-yirija/</span> 'Yirija (object of MANA noun class)'.</p>
<p>However, in forms with FSg or N<sup>g</sup>ARA class prefix <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span> we get <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ar-irija-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> (human FSg) and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ar-irija/</span> (nonhuman of class N<sup>g</sup>ARA). These point to <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>ara-irija(-yun<sup>g</sup>)//</span> as presurface form since <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ar-/</span> is the normal allomorph for this noun class prefix when the following stem is vowel-initial, but not otherwise. (See V-Truncation P-46.)</p>
<p>The other ex. of this type is the unusual human Pl form <span id = "nuy">/mand-irija/</span> 'persons of Yirija moiety (collective)'. Since the prefix here elsewhere shows up as <span id = "nuy">//man-//</span>  we assume that the <span id = "nuy">/d/</span> is due to d-Insertion P-21. The root must have presurface form <span id = "nuy">//-irija//</span> for this rule to apply, and in any event <span id = "nuy">//-yirija//</span> would produce the incorrect form  <span id = "nuy">/man<sup>y</sup>-jirija/</span> or  <span id = "nuy">/man-jirija/</span> </p>
<p>Our final minor ex. of this semivowel-deletion rule involves a root <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>ula-/</span> which shows up in verbal and nominal forms based on the sense 'two', and some closely related numeral stems. In such verbal forms as <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>ula-ga-/</span> 'to do (something) twice to (someone)' the inflected forms are consistent with presence of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> in all forms.</p>
<p>As a noun, the usual form is <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ula-wa:/</span> with Dual suffix, being the usual numeral for 'two'. This can occur with the usual inflectional noun class prefixes, as in <span id = "nuy">/na-wula-wa:/</span> 'two (men)'. However, more characteristically we get predicate-adjective forms like <span id = "nuy">/wini=wula-wa:/</span> 'they are two' (even when English uses a simple attributive numeral). In the MANA class form <span id = "nuy">/mu:='la-wa:/</span> we clearly have VV-Contraction P-49 involving the prefix <span id = "nuy">//ma-//</span> and the root, which must therefore have a presurface form <span id = "nuy">//=ula-wa://</span>  The same is true of ANA class form <span id = "nuy">/wu:='la-wa:/</span>  although this would not be easy to distinguish on the surface from  <span id = "nuy">/wu=wula-wa:/</span> except in relatively well-articulated speech. See 14.25.</p>
<p>The same alternations occur with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>ulan<sup>y</sup>baj/</span> 'three' and <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>ulalw<sub>2</sub>ulal/</span> 'four', which are etymologically related to <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>ula-/</span> 'two' and still probably closely associated with it synchronically (though not derived from it by otherwise established mechanisms).</p>
<p>The Homorganic Semivowel-Deletion rule P-4 must therefore be formulated as a loose grouping of distinct subrules which share only the basic property that a following homorganic short vowel is required for the deletion to occur.</p>

</table>
<p>As our discussion has implied, there are many stems beginning in <span id = "nuy">/yi/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/wu/</span> which do not undergo deletion by P-4 (and which therefore, for example, become <span id = "nuy">/ji/</span> and either <span id = "nuy">/gu/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/bu/</span> after stop or nasal). Exx. are <span id = "nuy">/yin<sup>g</sup>gulbandi/</span> 'barramundi fish', <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>uldha-/</span> 'to cut, sever', and <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>uruj/</span> 'human, person'. There are also some suffixes like <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ugij/</span> 'still, only' and <span id = "nuy">/-yin<sup>y</sup>un<sup>g</sup>/</span> (Relative) with stable semivowel except for optional omission in some environments by low-level rule P-28. There are some roots and prefixes which begin in <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/u/</span> with no evidence of underlying initial semivowel: <span id = "nuy">/in<sup>y</sup>gura/</span> 'Anindilyakwa (tribe)', <span id = "nuy">/=ijga-/</span> 'to take (dog) hunting', cpds. with <span id = "nuy">/-ij-/</span> 'word, truth', derived nouns with derivational ANA class prefix <span id = "nuy">/-uG-/</span>  While these will 'grow' an initial semivowel when word-initial by P-5, in all noninitial forms they behave like vowel-initial morphemes.</p>
