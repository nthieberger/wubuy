  <h1>3.23 Nasalisation P-22.</h1>
<p>We are here concerned, with assimilations of nasalisation in consonant clusters at boundaries, where an underlying stop is followed by a nasal.</p>
<p>The stops of Nunggubuyu are <span id = "nuy">/b dh d <u>d</u> j g/</span>  Of these, <span id = "nuy">/b dh/</span> do not occur at the end of morphemes (except for a couple of ininflectable verbal root forms or interjections ending in <span id = "nuy">/b/</span> , so they are irrelevant. Velar <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> is common at the end of stems and other morphemes, but is always deleted as nonfinal element in a consonant cluster by Stop-Deletion <a href = "FGN-3-30.html">P-29</a>, so it is also irrelevant. This leaves <span id = "nuy">/d <u>d</u> j/</span>.</p>
<p>Of these, <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> is by far the most common morpheme-finally. It is regularly nasalised to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> before a nasal consonant. For example, Pl prefix <span id = "nuy">//mij-//</span> is often followed by a nasal consonant, resulting in forms like <span id = "nuy">//mij-n<sup>g</sup>alan<sup>y</sup>ji//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/min<sup>y</sup>n<sup>g</sup>alan<sup>y</sup>ji/</span> 'girls'. For the underlying form <span id = "nuy">//mij-//</span> cf. <span id = "nuy">/mij-gulmur/</span> 'young circumcised men' from <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>ulmur/</span>  where the prefix must end in underlying <span id = "nuy">//j//</span> rather than <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>y</sup>//</span> (there being no denasalisation rule which could apply to this prefix). Similarly, compound initials like <span id = "nuy">/-lhaj-/</span> 'firewood' and <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>aj-/</span> '(solid) fat' show final <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> in compounds like <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>an<sup>y</sup>=ma-/</span> 'to get (solid) fat'. Nouns ending in <span id = "nuy">/j/</span> show <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>y</sup>/</span> before Instrumental suffix <span id = "nuy">/-miri/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">/wu-dhan<sup>y</sup>-miri/</span> 'by means of firewood' from <span id = "nuy">//uG-lhaj-miri//</span>  There are no consistent counterexx.</p> 
<p>Relevant combinations involving underlying morpheme-final <span id = "nuy">/d <u>d</u>/</span> are uncommon, since these are not high-frequency stem-final consonants. There are, however, a few noun stems ending in them which can be followed by Instrumental <span id = "nuy">/-miri/</span>  In these combinations Nasalisation is possible but not obligatory. Thus from <span id = "nuy">/yi:mid/</span> 'tree sp. (Planchonella)' we get <span id = "nuy">/yi:mid-miri/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/yi:min-miri/</span>  and from <span id = "nuy">/yimbi<u>d</u>/</span> 'cypress tree' we get <span id = "nuy">/yimbi<u>d</u>-miri/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/yimbi<u>n</u>-miri/</span>.</p>

<tr><td>d &#8594; n</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan = "3">usually obligatory for <span id = "nuy">/j/</span>  optional for <span id = "nuy">/d <u>d</u>/</span></td></tr>
</table>
<p>There is no strong argument against a more general formulation of the rule, to the effect that (any) stop is nasalised before a nasal. As noted above, <span id = "nuy">/b dh/</span> do not occur in the relevant context, so there is no reason to exclude them specifically. As for the remaining stop <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> (and the stop archiphoneme <span id = "nuy">/G/</span>  which is indistinguishable in its effects from <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> , we have mentioned that it just disappears in the relevant contexts. This can be taken care of by Stop-Deletion <a href = "FGN-3-30.html">P-29</a>, which deletes <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/G/</span> before any consonant. However, it would be possible in principle to allow P-22 to apply to combinations like <span id = "nuy">//g-n//</span>  giving intermediate <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>-n//</span>  since <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>/</span> is also subject to deletion before another nasal by Nasal-Deletion <a href = "FGN-3-31.html">P-30</a>. In other words, we could allow P-22 to apply to <span id = "nuy">//g//</span> as well as the other stops, though in the case of <span id = "nuy">//g//</span> the application would be vacuous so far as the eventual surface output is concerned.</p>
