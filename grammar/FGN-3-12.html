  <h1>3.12 Prefixal w<sub>2</sub>-Deletion P-11.</h1>
<p>Although we have noted in section §3.10, above, that <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is normally much more resistant to deletion than <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span>  there are a handful of specific morphological combinations where <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is regularly deleted. For cases involving <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> at the beginning of a stem, see the next section (§3.13). In the present section we deal with phenomena affecting pronominal prefixes attached to verbs.</p>
<p>As background we take the maximally abstract internal analysis of pronominal prefixes presented in Chapter 9. That is, in this analysis a pronominal prefix (specifying, say, both subject and object pronominal category for a transitive verb) can be broken down into a number of atomic morphemes tied together by an intricate relational system. If we do not accept this maximally abstract interpretation, and instead consider the pronominal prefixes to be internally unsegmentable, the following cases of Prefixal w<sub>2</sub>-Deletion would be regarded as at most of historical (not synchronic) interest.</p>
<p>The relevant atomic morphemes are <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>a-/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>V-/</span>  the latter with variable vowel. The morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span> is used chiefly to distinguish the A and B series of pronominal prefixes (Chapter 9), each series being associated with a particular set of verbal categories (tense, aspect, mood, negation; see Chapter 8). Thus 1Sg<sub>a</sub> <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-/</span> (e.g., in Present Positive) vs. 1Sg<sub>b</sub> <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-w<sub>2</sub>an-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an-/</span> (e.g., in Present Negative). The morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>a-/</span> occurs chiefly as the 1 &#8594; 2Sg<sub>b</sub> transitive prefix <span id = "nuy">/(w)a-/</span> and arguably in certain other combinations. The morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>V-/</span> is Nonsingular, and occurs in certain 2nd and 3rd person forms.</p>
<p>In the case of <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span>  basis for identifying the initial segment as <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is that surface <span id = "nuy">/b/</span> appears when this morpheme is preceded by Inverse morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-N-/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-N-w<sub>2</sub>an-w<sub>2</sub>i-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ambambi-/</span> '3Pl/WARA→ 1Sg<sub>b</sub>'. However, the corresponding '3Pl/WARA→ 1Sg<sub>a</sub>- form, lacking <span id = "nuy">/-N-/</span>  is <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-w<sub>2</sub>an-w<sub>2</sub>i-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ambi-/</span>  where the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> of <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span> has been deleted (with some subsequent readjustments as well). Moreover, when <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span> occurs in word-initial position (with no preceding morpheme), the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is usually not pronounced, except by some older persons. Thus compare 3MSg<sub>a</sub> <span id = "nuy">/ni-/</span> with 3MSg<sub>b</sub> <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>2</sub>an-ni-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/(w)ani-/</span></p>
<p>The 1 &#8594; 2Sg<sub>b</sub> morpheme is pronounced <span id = "nuy">/wa-/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/a-/</span>  depending on the speaker. However, the basic form seems to be <span id = "nuy">/wa-/</span>  since when the following morpheme (usually a verb root) begins in <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> we get surface <span id = "nuy">/wi:/</span> for all speakers, as in <span id = "nuy">//wa=i-yi://</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/wi:='-yi:/</span> 'I will give to you'. It is reasonable to argue that speakers who drop the semivowel in the form <span id = "nuy">/(w)a-/</span> have a deletion rule. The evidence for taking <span id = "nuy">/wa-/</span> as <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>a-/</span> rather than <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>a-/</span> is not very strong in this case; however, 2Sg→ 1ab <span id = "nuy">/numba-/</span>  variant <span id = "nuy">/nimba-/</span>  can perhaps be analysed as containing <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>a-/</span> as the final atomic morpheme, with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> appearing on the surface as <span id = "nuy">/b/</span>  There is also a 2Sg morpheme <span id = "nuy">/ba-/</span> which might also be related, though not by any synchronically productive rules.</p>
<p>The Nonsingular morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>V-/</span> has its surface vowel quality (where relevant) assigned either by morphologically based allomorph rules (Chapter 9), or else (in other combinations) by V-Assimilation P-37. The choice of vowel has no effect on the deletability of the semivowel. The latter is not deleted word-initially, hence it occurs as the initial part of <span id = "nuy">/wuru-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/wara-/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/wiri-/</span> (with various endings). Noninitially, the <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> is retained, in hardened form <span id = "nuy">/b/</span> by Hardening P-18, when immediately preceded by a nasal (Inverse <span id = "nuy">/-N-/</span> or B morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>an-/</span> , as in <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-N-w<sub>2</sub>i-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ambi-/</span> '3Pl/WARA &#8594; 1Sg<sub>a</sub>. However, when <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>V-/</span> is preceded by a vowel, the semivowel is always deleted with subsequent contraction of the two vowels (the relevant rules being VV-Contraction P-49 and Nonsg-Shortening P-41). Thus <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-w<sub>2</sub>a-ra-//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span> '1Sg &#8594; 3Pl/WARA<sub>a</sub>', among other exx. It should be noted that the treatment of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> in such forms permits us to avoid homophonies involving Multiple prefix <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>ara-/</span> (a derivational prefix inserted between pronominal prefix and stem), hence <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span> (just mentioned) is distinct from <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-ara-/</span> (variant <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a:-'ra-/</span>  with 1Sg &#8594; ANA<sub>Øa</sub> <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-/</span> followed by <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>ara-/</span>  Similarly, the failure of the present w<sub>2</sub>-Deletion rule to apply word-initially permits differentiation between <span id = "nuy">/wara-/</span> '3Pl/WARA &#8594; 3Pl/WARA<sub>a</sub>' (containing <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>V-) and /</span> &#216;-ara <span id = "nuy">/ (zero 'ANA/</span>MANA &#8594; ANA/MANA<sub>a</sub>b' prefix plus Multiple <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>ara-/</span> .</p>
<p>Because the three atomic morphemes beginning with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> which we have discussed show deletion of this semivowel in somewhat distinct environments, we formulate the rule in three parts.</p>
