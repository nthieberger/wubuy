  <h2>4.9 Uses of NC<sub>der</sub> prefixes; defective (bound) roots.</h2>

                <p>The prototypical usage of a NC<sub>der</sub> prefix (see bottom of
                        <ref type="int-t" target="4-1">Table 4-1 </ref>and discussion in §<ref
                        type="S" target="4.7">4.7</ref> for the forms) is to take a noun root (of
                    any noun class, or without predetermined noun class) and to convert it into a
                    derived noun of a specific target noun class. For example, the noun /gulmun<sup>g</sup>/ 'belly' happens to be in the MANA noun class. If we wish to create a
                    set of derived nouns which have overtly specified noun classes, we can add the
                    various NC<sub>der</sub> prefixes. Since 
                        /<span id="nuy">gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ begins with a stop, phonological rule <ref type="prule-int"
                        target="P-1">P-1</ref> applies to the derivatives, inserting a meaningless
                    morpheme /-n<sup>g</sup>u-/. The forms are thus (for nonhuman categories) /<span id="nuy">ni-n<sup>g</sup>u-gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ (NA class), /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>ari-n<sup>g</sup>u-gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ (N<sup>g</sup>ARA), /<span id="nuy">u-n<sup>g</sup>u-gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ (ANA or WARA class), and /<span id="nuy">ma-n<sup>g</sup>u-gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ (MANA class). Note that the derivative may end up with the same NC as
                    the simple root. In any event, the resulting derived noun can then receive the
                    usual nominal inflections for common nouns (Nc), including case suffixes and
                        NC<sub>infl</sub> prefixes. For example, the NA class form
                    may appear as /<span id="nuy">na-ni-n<sup>g</sup>u-gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ (with continuous NA prefix /na-/), or as /<span id="nuy">yi: -ni-n<sup>g</sup>u-gulmun<sup>g</sup> -guy</span>/ ‘to the
                    belly' with Allative-Dative suffix //<span id="nuy">-w<sub>1</sub>uy</span>// and (thus) with punctual NA prefix /yi:-/.</p>
                <p>NC<sub>der</sub> formations are used to make the noun class of the
                    derived noun match that of an independently occurring noun (which may or not
                    appear overtly in the same clause or discourse section). If we take our example
                    with /<span id="nuy">gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'belly', the NC<sub>der</sub> pattern would be used
                    when we want to specify 'belly of X', where X is some noun. It happens that
                    'belly' is the root used for roughly globular or convex parts of many objects,
                    such as the roundish fruits and nuts of many plants. The term for the plant (or
                    other object) has a given NC value, and to indicate the 'belly' (e.g., fruit) of
                    that particular object, we put 'belly' in the appropriate NC<sub>der</sub> form.</p>
                <p>Although many details about usage of NC<sub>der</sub> patterns are
                    lexical idiosyncracies, we should give a rough outline of the system here. Our
                    first observation is that NC<sub>der</sub> forms are most common
                    to refer to parts of inanimate objects (such as implements), plants, and (to a
                    lesser extent) animals. Most of the relevant noun roots do not take NC<sub">der</sub> prefixes to agree with the noun class of a human
                    referent. Thus, most body-part terms have a lexically specified inherent noun
                    class which appears as such when designating a part of a human being, as with /<span id="nuy">gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ (MANA class), but take derived form showing whole-to-part noun-class
                    harmony when designating corresponding parts of objects and plants (and
                    sometimes animals).</p>
 
            <anchor type="p" n="173"/><pb n="173" facs="HeathGrammar-173.jpg"/>

                <p>However, some human body parts are treated as parts of parts (cf. English 'roof
                    of the mouth', 'back of the tongue'), and in this event the more precise term
                    may take NC<sub>der</sub> form to agree in NC with the noun
                    designating the more inclusive body part.</p>
                <p>There are also some noun roots which do take NC<sub>der</sub> form
                    even when the whole is a human being (or beings). Such noun roots have more
                    elaborate NC<sub>der</sub> paradigms than do the majority of
                    roots which only have nonhuman derivatives. This is because the human NC<sub">der</sub> forms show other derivational morphology, such as
                    presence of Human Singular (HumSg) /<span id="nuy">-yun<sup>g</sup></span>/ or /<span id="nuy">-n<sup>y</sup>un<sup>g</sup></span>/ and Pl reduplication.</p>
                <p>A maximal paradigm is exemplified in <ref type="int-t" target="4-3">Table
                        4-3,</ref> which is based on the noun /muwaj/, whose underived noun class is
                        ANA<sub>wu</sub> (a subclass of the ANA class). As the
                    cross-references in the dictionary entry will indicate, this root is found now
                    and then in underived form, but most often in NC<sub>der</sub>
                    form (for human or nonhuman referent).</p>
                <p><img src="../img/tables/Table-4-3.jpg" width="587" height="504">
</p>					
                <p>A few other roots which can have NC<sub>der</sub> forms may be
                    briefly mentioned, /<span id="nuy">w<sub>1</sub>ubulu</span>/ 'body, torso' is common as  /<span id="nuy">NC<sub>der</sub>-gubulu</span>/  (see dictionary entry) with nonhumans, and an ex. with human reference
                    has turned up now in MT 25<sup>:</sup> in my transcription /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>ara-n<sup>g</sup>ari-gubulu-yun<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'her body (corpse)'. Similar exx. involving root /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>aga<u>r</u>a</span>/ are cited in the dictionary entry; the root means 'bone(s)' but the
                    human NC<sub>der</sub> form is used in the sense 'skeleton'. I do
                    not know if  /<span id="nuy">aju<u>l</u>u</span>/  'skeleton' has similar forms (my data show it in underived form with
                    human reference). However,  /<span id="nuy">mabu<u>n</u>u</span>/  'decomposed body' does take human NC<sub>der</sub>
                    forms (see entry). Some others which may have human forms are /<span id="nuy">mawur</span>/ 'spirit', /<span id="nuy">-lha<u>r</u>in<sup>y</sup>-</span>/ 'boss' (different meaning with nonhuman reference), /<span id="nuy">yinag</span>/ 'head'
                    (found once with NC<sub>der</sub> referring to dreamtime being),
                    /<span id="nuy">-mandag-</span>/ 'group, gang' (used in Pl), /<span id="nuy">w<sub>1</sub>anburg</span>/ 'exact likeness, spitting image', /<span id="nuy">gadhuwa</span>/ 'young, new', and /<span id="nuy">man<sup>g</sup>aj</span>/ 'fat (one)'. There are also a handful of NAdj which take NC<sub>der</sub> prefix to create a feminine counterpart from an
                    underived stem which is used with masculine sense; these are the patrilineal
                    moiety terms /<span id="nuy">yirija</span>/ and  /<span id="nuy">mi<u>n</u>iguya</span>/  and the stem /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>amba<u>r</u>a</span>/ 'eldest, elder (e.g., sibling)'. In the cases of the two moiety terms,
                    the regular Pl (for either sex) is not a NC<sub>der</sub> form,
                    but for /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>amba<u>r</u>a</span>/ we can get a Pl based specifically on the derived FSg form (see
                    dictionary entries for details).</p>
                <p>We have seen that there are differences among types of referent (human, animal,
                    plant, object) regarding applicability of NC<sub>der</sub>
                    formations to nouns designating parts or other intrinsic features. There are
                    also differences among nouns designating parts or other inalienable features,
                    regarding their own propensity to show up in derived or underived form.</p>
                <p>In addition to nouns like /<span id="nuy">gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'belly; spherical or convex part' which occur productively both as
                    simple stems and with NC<sub>der</sub>, prefixes, there is a set
                    of defective (bound) roots which cannot be used as simple noun stems. If used as
                    nouns, they require NC<sub>der</sub> prefixes. (Most of them can
                    also be used as compound initials.) They are labeled "Nc/Pref" at the head of
                    lexical entries.</p>
                <p>Ideally, in each textual occurrence, a defective root should have a derived NC
                    value based on the lexical NC of an associated referent. I believe that this
                    pattern is at least approximated with some of the bound roots, such as /-lhag-/
                    'end, tip' and /<span id="nuy">-lhawir-</span>/ 'scraps'. However, we must analyse this point more closely, since many
                    defective roots appear to have an unmarked noun-class value.</p>
                <p>This is the case with three bound roots designating entrails: /<span id="nuy">-lhan<sup>g</sup>aj-</span>/ 'entrails', /<span id="nuy">-(w<sub>1</sub>)uwanima-</span>/ 'large intestine', and /<span id="nuy">-(w<sub>1</sub>)ugulhanun<sup>y</sup>-</span>/ 'small intestines'. These all have an unmarked MANA form, e.g., /<span id="nuy">(mana-)ma-dhan<sup>g</sup>an<sup>y</sup></span>/, regardless of referent, and are used in this form referring to humans
                    as well. Probably the independent nouns /<span id="nuy">da:n</span>/ and <span id="nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>udan</span>/ 'guts, internal organs', both in MANA class, are the relevant
                    influences here. Other defective roots preferring the MANA class include /<span id="nuy">-dha<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>-</span>/ and /<span id="nuy">-w<sub>1</sub>a<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>gay-</span>/ 'spear shaft' and /<span id="nuy">-n<sup>g</sup>ulha-</span>/ and (presumably) /<span id="nuy">-n<sup>g</sup>ulyir-</span>/ 'spear blade' (the generic term for 'spear' is MANA class  /<u>l</u>arda/ , although more specific types of spear show other class values as
                    well); /<span id="nuy">-w<sub>1</sub><u>l</u>ar-</span>/ 'stem' (applied mainly to a few sedges and similar plants, most of
                    which have MANA class); and /<span id="nuy">-w<sub>2</sub>i<u>r</u>il-</span>/ 'water lily leaf' (about half of the terms for water lily spp. and
                    their parts are in MANA class, see p. <ref type="ext-d" target="312">312</ref>
                    of dictionary, section 1.B.xix).</p>
                <p>Many defective roots, however, prefer ANA class, either ANA<sub>Ø</sub> or ANA<sub>wu</sub> subclass. ANA<sub>Ø</sub> is found with words associated with wild honey bees (Trigona spp.)
                    and their products: /<span id="nuy">-galg-</span>/ 'honey bee', /<span id="nuy">-n<sup>g</sup>arag-</span>/ 'honey', etc. (see dictionary entry for the generic term  /<span id="nuy"><u>l</u>agu</span>/  'honey and honey bees' for further information). ΑΝΑ<sub>Ø</sub> is also favoured with /-dhanba<u>r</u>j-</span>/ 'fishtail', because the general term /n<sup>g</sup>ujija</span>/ 'fish' is ANA<sub>Ø</sub>. ANA<sub>wu</sub> is the unmarked NC<sub>der</sub> form in these
                    cases: /<span id="nuy">-ban-</span>/ 'smoke' (cf. ANA<sub>wu</sub>
                    /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>u<u>r</u>a</span></span>/ 'fire'); /<span id="nuy">-lhaj-</span>/ 'chopped wood, firewood' (cf. 'fire', also ANA<sub>wu</sub>
                    /<span id="nuy"><u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>ag</span>/ 'tree, wood'); /<span id="nuy">-lhawal-</span>/ 'splinter, thorn' (cf. 'wood');</p>

            <anchor type="p" n="175"/><pb n="175" facs="HeathGrammar-175.jpg"/>

                <p>/<span id="nuy">-n<sup>g</sup>arg-</span>/ 'shore, beach' (cf. perhaps /<span id="nuy">lha:1</span>/ 'country', ANA<sub>wu</sub>); /<span id="nuy">-lhan<sup>g</sup>urg-</span>/ 'disease' (functions as most general term; more specific terms for
                    disease/injury are mostly also ANA<sub>wu</sub>; see pp. 334-35
                    of dictionary); /<span id="nuy">-mala-</span>/ 'sky' and /<span id="nuy">-malg-</span>/ 'night sky' (a number of other terms
                    for weather and time of day are ANA<sub>wu</sub>, see p. <ref
                        type="ext-d" target="326">326</ref> of dictionary [in section 5.D.i emend
                    "Mana" to "AnaWu" as noun class for /<span id="nuy">min<sup>y</sup>n<sup>g</sup>u</span>/ 'night']), and /<span id="nuy">-lhamig-</span>/ 'taste' (nouns for 'smell' are also ANA<sub>wu</sub>, though not defective roots).</p>
                <p>I know of no bound roots for which WARA is the unmarked NC value. NA is the
                    preferred class in a small number of cases closely associated with a NA
                    referent: /<span id="nuy">-n<sup>g</sup>aln<sup>g</sup>-</span>/ 'woomera hook' (cf.  /<span id="nuy">wa<u>nd</u>ag</span>/  and near-synonyms 'woomera', all NA class); /<span id="nuy">nidhamun<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'clitoris' may be a frozen NA class NC<sub>der</sub>
                    form */<span id="nuy">ni-dhamun<sup>g</sup></span>/ (root */<span id="nuy">-lhamun<sup>g</sup>-</span>/) with NC value based on /<span id="nuy"><u>r</u>i:g</span>/ 'vagina', cf. synonymous /<span id="nuy">ni-dhan<sup>y</sup></span>/ 'clitoris' derived from /<span id="nuy">lha:n<sup>y</sup></span>/ 'tongue'. N<sup>g</sup>ARA is rare as unmarked NC of
                    derived nouns, but there are one or two terms for parts of dugong (/<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>aruga<u>l</u>ij</span>/, N<sup>g</sup>ARA class) like /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>ari-mawa<u>r</u>u</span>/ which naturally show up in N<sup>g</sup>ARA class
                    form.</p>
                <p>Overall, we can say that these "unmarked" NC assignments for bound noun roots are
                    usually not lexically arbitrary. Usually they are either a reflection of the
                    fact that a particular bound root may happen to be prototypically associated
                    with referent nouns of a particular NC, or else that they belong to a semantic
                    domain (e.g., disease/injury) whose members are predominantly in a single noun
                    class.</p>
                <p>The nouns which can take NC<sub>der</sub> forms, including both
                    ordinary and defective (bound) roots, are primarily in these categories:</p>
                <p>a) habitat ('nest', 'hive', 'burrow');</p>
                <p>b) external parts ('face', 'tip', 'blade', 'stem', etc.);</p>
                <p>c) internal parts ('intestine', etc.);</p>
                <p>d) bodily substance or secretion ('skin', 'excrement', etc.);</p>
                <p>e) entire body ('body', 'corpse', 'skeleton', 'sprout', 'baby');</p>
                <p>f) incorporeal attribute ('name', 'spirit');</p>
                <p>g) sensory emission ('taste', 'smell', 'image','trace');</p>
                <p>h) collectivity ('group', 'multitude').</p>
                <p>As we have seen, there are also a handful of nouns functioning much like NAdj
                    ('boss', 'new, young', 'elder') which can occur in NC<sub>der</sub> form, at least under certain conditions. In the following chapter
                    we will see further exx. of NC<sub>der</sub> forms with kin
                    terms, both to mark referent gender (with the usual human senses) and to mark
                    nonhuman NC referent on those occasions where kin terms like 'mother' are
                    applied to animals, or even inanimate objects.</p>
                <p>It would be interesting to do a complete the semantic extensions of basic
                    body-part terms in NC<sub>der</sub> forms, particularly as
                    applied to parts of plants and objects. We do not yet have adequate data for
                    such a study. However, we may mention a few basic points (see dictionary entries
                    for more details and textual citations). A basic opposition 'front' / 'back'
                    applied to many objects is made using derived forms of the body parts /yinag/
                    'face' and /<span id="nuy">bi<u>r</u>a</span>/ 'anus', respectively. For erect objects such as trees, derivatives of  /<span id="nuy">amba<u>l</u></span>/  'top of head' are used for 'top' (for 'bottom' we usually have just
                    the NAdv /<span id="nuy">lhiribala</span>/ 'under, inside').</p>

            <anchor type="p" n="176"/><pb n="176" facs="HeathGrammar-176.jpg"/>

                <p>Some referents use /<span id="nuy"><u>r</u>ulbu</span>/ ‘back, backbone' in the sense 'back' or ‘base' (of object), and in
                        ANA<sub>wu</sub> form this root can mean 'mainland' (as
                    opposed to 'sea'). A similar term /<span id="nuy">malan<sup>y</sup></span>/ 'backbone' is used in NC<sub>der</sub> form to mean
                    'dorsal fin' (of fish), while /<span id="nuy">an<sup>y</sup>jabal</span>/ 'armpit' in underived or derived form can be extended to 'pectoral
                    fin'. Derived forms of /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>aga<u>r</u>a</span>/ 'bone' can mean 'hard part' (e.g., tough membrane), as well as
                    'skeleton' (already exemplified). From /<span id="nuy">lhan<sup>g</sup>gu</span>/ 'flesh' we can get NC<sub>der</sub> forms for 'flesh,
                    meat' of particular animals (but 'flesh' of nut or shellfish is expressed by a
                    special term /<span id="nuy">-w<sub>1</sub>in-</span>/ in its derived forms), /<span id="nuy">w<sub>1</sub>ubulu</span>/ 'body' has straightforward applications to animals, plants, and
                    objects, but can also mean 'true identity as referent' or the like (though this
                    is most clearly seen elsewhere in a compound involving this root). From /<span id="nuy">baga<u>l</u>an<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'eye' we can get derivatives meaning 'seed, nut' of certain plants, as
                    in nearby languages, but in Nunggubuyu this usage is somewhat limited due to
                    competition with derivatives of /<span id="nuy">gulmun<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'belly'. From /<span id="nuy">lha:n<sup>y</sup></span>/ 'tongue' we get NC<sub>der</sub> forms meaning 'blade
                    of spear' and 'clitoris' (i.e., tongue of vagina). From /<span id="nuy">dhalbar</span>/ 'upper leg' we get the extensions 'hind leg' (of quadruped) and
                    '(tree) branch', either in derived or underived form; /<span id="nuy">w<sub>2</sub>a<u>n</u>ja</span>/ 'arm' has derivatives meaning 'wing' and
                    'sleeve of shirt'. From /<span id="nuy">ma<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup></span>/ 'fingers, hand' we get a slightly irregular /<span id="nuy">NC<sub>der</sub>-n<sup>g</sup>u-ma<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup></span>/ (/-n<sup>g</sup>u-/ is usually inserted before stops, not nasals) which can mean, among
                    other things, 'root tuber' (of one type of swamp plant), while forms of  /<span id="nuy"><u>l</u>a:n</span>/  'knee' are used to designate the smaller root corms of certain sedges.
                    It is not clear whether /<span id="nuy">mala</span>/, a simple noun meaning 'navel', is related in
                    some way to either of two derivative types  /<span id="nuy">NC<sub>der</sub>-mala</span>/  (listed separately in the dictionary), meaning respectively 'clear
                    sky' (there is also one usage of derivatives of /<span id="nuy">n<sup>g</sup>aga<u>r</u>a</span>/ 'bone' with this extended meaning) and 'thick honey (honeycomb)'.</p>
                <p>Clearly a more thorough semantic investigation would be worthwhile. (We would
                    have to consider uses of these roots, or their suppletive replacements, in
                    compounds as well.) However, we should not exaggerate the extent of these
                    human-to-nonhuman body-part extensions and metaphors. As can be seen from the
                    list on pp. 322-23 of the dictionary, there are many terms for parts of plants,
                    objects, and animals which are not special uses of terms also applied to human
                    parts ('gill', 'juice/sap', 'spear shaft', etc.), even though it might have been
                    possible to find a human term which could appropriately have these as secondary
                    meanings.</p>
