  <h1>3.4 Final Reduplication P-3.</h1>
<p>This rule applies only to a derived demonstrative form meaning '(on) this/that side'. The derived form involves reduplicating the final <span id = "nuy">/CV/</span> of the demonstrative pronoun or adverb which serves as input. The Centripetal suffix <span id = "nuy">/-ala/</span> is added. There is also a parallel but less common form with Centrifugal <span id = "nuy">/-ali/</span>  For further details and exx. see ยง7.21 (also ยง6.11).</p>
<p>Consider these input forms: <span id = "nuy">/ya:-ni/</span> 'this (ANA class)' and adverb <span id = "nuy">/ya:-ji/</span> 'here'. The relevant derived forms are <span id = "nuy">//ya;-ni-ni-ala//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/ya:-ni-ni:-'la/</span> and <span id = "nuy">//ya:-ji-ji-ala//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/ya:-ji-ji:-'la/</span></p> 
<p>These forms present no difficulties; we just reduplicate the final <span id = "nuy">/CV/</span>  add <span id = "nuy">/-ala/</span>  and have the surface form produced regularly by VV-Contraction P-49. However, some difficulties arise in insuring that human nonsingular forms are correctly generated.</p>
<p>Consider input forms <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wi-<u>n</u>i/</span> (MDu), <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wi-r-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> (FDu) and <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wu-ru/</span> (Pl) 'these'. The derived forms are <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wi-<u>n</u>i-<u>n</u>i:-'la/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wi-r-n<sup>g</sup>i-n<sup>g</sup>i:-'la/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wu-ra-ra:-'la/</span>  These forms force us to specify more precisely what gets reduplicated and also whether the -Rdp- segment precedes or follows the relevant input syllable.</p>
<p>In the FDu form, note that the <span id = "nuy">/-r-/</span> morpheme is not included in the -Rdp- segment. This is a Nonsingular morpheme. Only the F morpheme (Feminine) gets reduplicated.</p>
<p>In the MSg form, <span id = "nuy">/-<u>n</u>i-/</span> is arguably underlying <span id = "nuy">//-r-ni-//</span> with the same Nonsingular <span id = "nuy">//-r-//</span> and M <span id = "nuy">//-ni-//</span>  which is related to other M morphemes in verbal and nominal morphology with <span id = "nuy">/n/</span>  not <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>  A rule <span id = "nuy">//rn//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/<u>n</u>/</span>  though unproductive, could possibly be recognised (see P-24, below). If so, we must argue that this contraction rule precedes Final Reduplication, since in the relevant MSg form we get <span id = "nuy">/-<u>n</u>i-<u>n</u>i:-/</span> instead of  <span id = "nuy">/-ni-<u>n</u>i:-/</span></p>
<p>The Pl form is even more tricky. From input <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wu-ru/</span> we might expect output  <span id = "nuy">//ya:-wu-ru-ru-ala//</span>  which would produce surface  <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wu-ru-ra:-'la/</span>  but the attested form is <span id = "nuy">/ya:-wu-ra-ra:-'la/</span>  Note that the third morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-ra-/</span> shares surface vowel quality with the following syllable. However, the latter in turn has acquired its surface vowel quality through VV-Contraction involving the initial vowel of the Centripetal suffix, with <span id = "nuy">//ua//</span> becoming <span id = "nuy">/a:/</span>  In generative terms, then, it is probably best to order Final Reduplication P-3 after VV-Contraction P-49. If this is done, we must locate the -Rdp- segment before the identical segment of the input, and specify that the vowel of the -Rdp- segment is short regardless of the length of the input vowel.</p>
<table>
<tr><td>(P-3) Final Reduplication</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rdp &#8594; -C1V1- // D- _____ -C1V1(:)-</td></tr>
<tr><td>where D- is a demonstrative root</td></tr>
</table>
<p>An alternative would be to take <span id = "nuy">//ya:-wu-ru-ru-ala//</span> as the underlying form after all, with P-3 followed by an ad hoc assimilation rule. This would require the assimilation rule, but not P-3 itself, to follow VV-Contraction P-49. Another alternative, for those linguists not favorable to generative rules, would be a surface-to-surface schema deriving the reduplicated form directly from the unreduplicated surface form (this would be relatively easy in this instance).</p>
