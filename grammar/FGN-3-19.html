  <h1>3.19 Hardening  P-18.</h1>
<p>This is a very important rule by which certain continuants are converted into a homorganic stop after a stop or nasal; it is thus essentially the opposite of Lenition <a href = "FGN-3-17.html">P-16</a>. (A distinct hardening rule applying to a few stems under particular circumstances is presented in the following section.)</p>
The basic Hardening rule is this:
<table>
<tr><td>(P-18)</td><td colspan = "7">Hardening</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan = "6"><img src = "../img/l_curly.png" height = "300px"/></td><td>w<sub>2</sub> &#8594; b</td><td rowspan = "6"><img src = "../img/r_curly.png" height = "300px"/></td><td rowspan = "6" valign = "top">//</td><td rowspan = "2"><img src = "../img/l_curly.png" height = "100px"/><td>Stop</td><td rowspan = "2"><img src = "../img/r_curly.png" height = "100px"/><td rowspan = "6" valign = "top">-__</td></tr>
<tr><td>1h &#8594; dh</td><td rowspan = "5" valign = "top">Nasal</td></tr>
<tr><td>r &#8594; d	(in some morphemes)</td></tr>
<tr><td><u>r</u> &#8594; <u>d</u></td></tr>
<tr><td>y &#8594; j</td></tr>
<tr><td>w<sub>1</sub> &#8594; g</td></tr> 
</table>
<p>There are no exceptions to the rule, except for <span id = "nuy">//r//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/d/</span>  and no surface clusters created by later rules which escape it.</p>
<p>However, the rule applies only to the continuants listed; it does not apply to <span id = "nuy">/1/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/<u>1</u>/</span>  for example, even though it does apply to <span id = "nuy">/lh/</span>  This is presumably because <span id = "nuy">/1/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/<u>1</u>/</span> are not "paired" with any particular stop (if associated with <span id = "nuy">/d/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/<u>d</u>/</span> they would overlap with <span id = "nuy">/r/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>/</span> morphophonemically).</p>
<p>Although in most cases the stop is historically basic, there is good reason to take the continuant as underlying synchronically. This is because, in addition to the stems showing the stop/continuant alternations, there is another set showing consistent initial stop, but no third set showing consistent initial continuant. Moreover, the alternating stems show the surface stop only after stop or nasal, and show the continuant in all other environments, including word-initially.</p>
<p>The subrule <span id = "nuy">//r//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/d/</span> is not very important, since very few morphemes begin with underlying <span id = "nuy">/r/</span> (though <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>/</span> is common). The most common is Locative case suffix <span id = "nuy">/-ruj/</span>  which does become <span id = "nuy">/-duj/</span> after stop or nasal, as in <span id = "nuy">//a-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>ag-ruj//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/a-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a-duj/</span> 'in the tree' (note that the <span id = "nuy">//g//</span> constitutes the conditioning environment for Hardening but is then deleted by a later rule, probably Geminate Contraction P-31). Similarly, the Dyadic kin term <span id = "nuy">/mi-digi-j/</span> 'mother and child group' contains Pl <span id = "nuy">//mij-//</span> and <span id = "nuy">/rigi-j/</span> 'mother and child pair'.</p>
<p>However, <span id = "nuy">//r//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/d/</span> does not work for verbs. There are two relevant stems, <span id = "nuy">/=ra-/</span> 'to swear at' and <span id = "nuy">/=ru-bu-/</span> 'to cook on open fire', and when preceded by stop or nasal they do not harden the <span id = "nuy">/r/</span>  hence <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>aN=ru-bu-ma-na//</span> &#8594;; <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=ru-bu-ma-na/</span> 'I will cook it (ΑNΑ<sub>&#216;</sub>)'. This is also true of compound verbs beginning with <span id = "nuy">/-riN-/</span> (compound initial used in myths as characteristic of the speech of Brolga).</p>
<p>There is also a minor instance of <span id = "nuy">//r//</span> becoming <span id = "nuy">/<u>d</u>/</span> instead of <span id = "nuy">/d/</span>  This is Dyadic <span id = "nuy">/ramu-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> 'FaMo and SoCh pair' and its Pl form <span id = "nuy">/mi-<u>d</u>amu-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> 'FaMo and SoCh group', again with Pl <span id = "nuy">//mij-//</span>  However, we should remark that Pl Dyadic kin terms are rather irregular, with <span id = "nuy">/mi<u>d</u>-/</span> sometimes appearing as Pl allomorph before stem beginning (otherwise) in a vowel, so it is perhaps misleading to treat this as a straightforward case of <span id = "nuy">//r//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/<u>d</u>/</span>.</p>
<p>The other continuant/stop alternations in the rule, indicated above, are attested with hundreds of morphemes in all positions in the word. For example, most of the case suffixes begin with a continuant: Relative <span id = "nuy">/-yin<sup>y</sup>un<sup>g</sup>/</span>  Allative-Dative <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>uy/</span>  Simple Pergressive <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>aj/</span>  etc.; these all show hardened variants when the stem ends in stop or nasal, so with <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>ag/</span> 'wood' we get <span id = "nuy">/a-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a-jin<sup>y</sup>un<sup>g</sup>/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/a-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a-guy/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/a-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>a-baj/</span>  Nouns like this one which permit derivational noun class prefixes like ANA <span id = "nuy">//uG-//</span> and MANA <span id = "nuy">//maG-//</span> also show alternations at the prefix boundary, hence <span id = "nuy">//uG-<u>r</u>an<sup>g</sup>ag//</span> #5894; <span id = "nuy">/wu-<u>d</u>an<sup>g</sup>ag/</span> 'wood (of ANA object)'. Verb stems can be preceded by prefixes ending in stops or nasals, such as 1Sg<sub>b</sub> <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>aN-//</span> (contrast 1Sg<sub>a</sub> <span id = "nuy">//n<sup>g</sup>a-//</span> , hence with <span id = "nuy">/=ya-n<sup>g</sup>gi/</span> 'went' we get Past Continuous <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=ya-n<sup>g</sup>gi/</span> vs. Past Potential <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an<sup>y</sup>=ja-n<sup>g</sup>gi/</span>.</p>
<p>Further exx. are <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=wi-ni/</span> 'I hit it (ΑNΑ<sub>&#216;</sub>)' vs. <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>am=bi-ni/</span> 'I would have hit it' with <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>2</sub>//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/b/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=lna-y/</span> 'I stood' vs. <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an=dha-y/</span> 'I would have stood' with <span id = "nuy">//lh//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/dh/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=<u>r</u>iyaldha-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> 'I got angry' vs. <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a<u>n</u>=<u>d</u>iyaldha-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> 'I would have gotten mad' with <span id = "nuy">//<u>r</u>//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/<u>d</u>/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=ya-y/</span> 'I slept' VS. <span id = "nuy">&#8594;/n<sup>g</sup>an<sup>y</sup>=ja-y/</span> 'I would have slept’ with <span id = "nuy">//y//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/j/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a=wuldha-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> 'I cut it (ANA<sub>&#216;</sub>)' vs. <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an<sup>g</sup>=guldha-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> 'I would have cut it' with <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/g/</span>  (These particular exx. also show Nasal-Assimilation P-27.)
<p>Other, less productive, stop/continuant alternations are dealt with in connection with Leftward-Hardening P-19 (below), and with Lenition <a href = "FGN-3-17.html">P-16</a> and digu-Lenition <a href = "FGN-3-18.html">P-17</a> (above).</p>
