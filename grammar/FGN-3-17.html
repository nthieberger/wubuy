  <h1>3.17 Lenition  P-16.</h1>
<p>The language has a number of important alternations of stop and continuant, of the type j/y, b/w, g/w, <u>d</u>/<u>r</u>, dh/lh, and (rarely) d/r. In the majority of these alternations, we are dealing with an underlying continuant which is "hardened" to a stop after a nasal or stop. On the other hand, stems beginning with underlying stop retain this stop in all forms; in the environments where the continuant-initial stems undergo Hardening, the stop-initial stems add a preposed morpheme <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>u-/</span>  These are the regular treatments of stem-initial continuants and stops; see discussion of n<sup>g</sup>u-Epenthesis <a href="FGN-3-2.html">P-1</a> (above) and Hardening P-18 (below).</p>
<p>However, in addition to the regular patterns, there are some more specialised patterns observed with a minority of stems, requiring supplementary rules applying only to such stems. Basically, this minority type behaves like a stop-initial type when no compound initial (or derivational prefix) precedes, and like a continuant-initial type in compounded/derived position. Moreover, consideration of reduplications and other details shows that there are really at least two minority patterns of this general type, requiring distinct analyses.</p>
<p>One subtype, to be described in connection with Leftward Hardening P-19 in section ยง3.20 (below), appears to have underlying continuant, but shows hardening to a stop when immediately preceded by an inflectional prefix or by zero. Thus <span id = "nuy">/dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'short', <span id = "nuy">/wu=dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'it is short', etc. Compare the form <span id = "nuy">/-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> as compound final or after derivational prefix, as in <span id = "nuy">/wu<u>r</u>ugu-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'small (short) lake'. The crucial reduplicated Pl form is <span id = "nuy">/dhama-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span>  becoming <span id = "nuy">/-lhama-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> in compounds and derivatives. Because the reduplicative segment is bisyllabic, the base form should be <span id = "nuy">//lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur//</span> at the time of Initial Reduplication <a href="FGN-3-3.html">P-2</a>, even in uncompounded forms, so what we need is a later rule converting the continuant, here <span id = "nuy">//lh//</span>  into a stop, here <span id = "nuy">/dh/</span>  in the relevant positions. This is what is done by Leftward Hardening P-19. (It should be noted that the hardened form <span id = "nuy">/-dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> and the unhardened form <span id = "nuy">/-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> produced by P-19 are themselves subject to later, lower-level rules, and that <span id = "nuy">/-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> may become <span id = "nuy">/-dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> by the regular Hardening rule P-18 if preceded by stop or nasal.)</p>
<p>In the present section, however, we are concerned not with this subtype, rather with a distinct one which we will exemplify with <span id = "nuy">/=dhida-/</span> 'to close off'. Leaving aside the reduplications, we observe that when no compound initial or derivational prefix is present, the stem behaves like underlying <span id = "nuy">/=dhida-/</span>  however, when such an element is present, the stem behaves like <span id = "nuy">/=lhida-/</span>  as in <span id = "nuy">/-gari=lhida-/</span> 'to shut off from behind'. The representation <span id = "nuy">/=lhida-/</span> is also appropriate for instances in compounds/derivatives where <span id = "nuy">//lh//</span> becomes <span id = "nuy">/dh/</span> after nasal or stop by the regular Hardening rule P-18. So far, the alternation <span id = "nuy">/=dhida-/</span> vs. <span id = "nuy">/=lhida-/</span> is like that of <span id = "nuy">/-dhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/-lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> (preceding paragraph). However, if 'to close off' were fully parallel to 'short', the regular reduplication by <a href="FGN-3-2.html">P-1</a><!-- should be P-2? --> should be <span id = "nuy">/-dhidi=lhida-/</span>  with the bisyllabic reduplicative segment appropriate for stems beginning in continuants, and with the post-reduplicative stem overtly showing the continuant. Instead, we get <span id = "nuy">/-dhi=dhida-/</span>  which is the regular reduplication for stop-initial stems. Despite the similarities, it seems important to distinguish the subtype represented by <span id = "nuy">/ -lhamun<sup>g</sup>ur/</span> 'short' (where the continuant is clearly underlying) from that represented by <span id = "nuy">/=dhida-/</span> 'to close off'. In the latter case, I choose to take the form with stop as basic, and set up a rule leniting the stop to the homorganic continuant, here <span id = "nuy">//dh//</span> to <span id = "nuy">/lh/</span>  when the stem is preceded by a compound initial or derivational prefix (not including simple reduplicative segments). The derivational prefixes here include Benefactive <span id = "nuy">/-aG-/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/-wa:G-/</span>  Multiple <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>ara-/</span> and its allomorphs, etc.; an ex. of Benef is <span id = "nuy">/-wa:=dhida-/</span> 'to shut off for', which must have a form <span id = "nuy">//-wa:G=lhida-//</span> rather than  <span id = "nuy">//-wa:G=dhida-//</span> at an early stage, since the latter would incorrectly give  <span id = "nuy">/-wa:-n<sup>g</sup>u=dhida-/</span> by n<sup>g</sup>u-Epenthesis <a href="FGN-3-2.html">P-1</a>.</p>
<p>The full set of lenitions attested in verbs of this type is: <span id = "nuy">//b/</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span>  <span id = "nuy">//dh//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/lh/</span>  <span id = "nuy">//j//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/y/</span>  <span id = "nuy">//<u>d</u>//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">//g//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span>  In other words, formally Lenition is the inverse of Hardening (P-18, also P-19), which converts these same continuants into these same stops. Very often the effects of Lenition are apparently undone by subsequent application of Hardening P-18. This is seen in the ex. 'to shut off for' (preceding paragraph), and is regular for those stems which undergo Lenition in compounds and derivatives when the preceding morpheme happens to end in a stop or nasal, as is the case with Benef <span id = "nuy">/-aG-/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/-wa:G-/</span> (where <span id = "nuy">/G/</span> is a stop archiphoneme). However, even in such exx., Lenition applies early in the derivation to generate the correct output, by preventing the application of n<sup>g</sup>u-Epenthesis <a href="FGN-3-2.html">P-1</a>.</p>

<p>It remains to specify the set of stems which are affected. There are a number of clear cases where all attested forms are consistent with P-16; there are a few stems which show the effects of the rule in some compounds/derivatives but not others; and there are some ambiguous or idiosyncratic cases requiring separate commentary. In the following discussion and lists we separate verbs from nouns. Verbs to which P-16 applies regularly are:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=ja<u>r</u>ya<u>r</u>a/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/ya<u>r</u>ya<u>r</u>a-/</span></td><td>'to go down'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=ba<u>r</u>ama/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/ w<sub>2</sub>a<u>r</u>ama-/</span></td><td>'to be constipated'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=barlha/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>arlha-/</span></td><td>'to be stiff'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=dhalba:rinyji/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/lhalba:r inyji-/</span></td><td>'to spread out'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=dhida/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/lhida-/</span></td><td>'to close off'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=dhilila/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/lhilila-/</span></td><td>'to drip'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=<u>d</u>ilin<sup>g</sup>iriya/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/<u>r</u>ilin<sup>g</sup>iriya-/</span></td><td>'to lean'</td></tr>

<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=jiryira/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/yiryira-/</span></td><td>'to drip'</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The lefthand column shows the underlying form, also the dictionary citation form; the middle column shows the form after P-16. The actual data are set out in the dictionary entries; for some of these the data are not complete, and further data might show that some show Lenition only in certain compounds, or that one or two of these verbs have underlying continuant and undergo Leftward Hardening P-19 instead of P-16.</p>
<p>Other verbs to which P-16 applies in some compounds/derivatives only (perhaps only to older, more frozen ones), are these:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=balhu/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>alhu-/</span</td><td>'to cut up'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=barga/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>arga-/</span</td><td>'to set ablaze'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=bilya/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>ilya-/</span</td><td>'to be tilted'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/=burda-/</span></td><td><span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>urda-/</span</td><td>'to dig'</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are also some nouns, including adjectival nouns, which can be considered exx. of P-16. For the nonadjectival nouns, few cases of compound-final position are attested. However, there is an important set of derivational noun-class prefixes like ANA or WARA class <span id = "nuy">/uG-/</span> and MANA class <span id = "nuy">/maG-/</span>  When the following noun stem begins with an underlying stop. n<sup>g</sup>u-Epenthesis <A href = "FGN-3-2.html">P-1</a> normally applies, hence <span id = "nuy">/uG-gulmun<sup>g</sup>/</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/wu-n<sup>g</sup>u-gulmun<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'its belly' (ANA or WARA class). However, a few such nouns beginning in stops fail to show the <span id = "nuy">/-n<sup>g</sup>u-/</span> morpheme. Thus from <span id = "nuy">/dhan<sup>g</sup>ara/</span> 'flower' we get <span id = "nuy">/wu-dhan<sup>g</sup>ara/</span> 'its flower', not  <span id = "nuy">/wu-n<sup>g</sup>u-dhan<sup>g</sup>ara/</span>  The form <span id = "nuy">/wu-dhan<sup>g</sup>ara/</span> is what we would expect if the base form were <span id = "nuy">//uG-lhan<sup>g</sup>ara//</span>  since n<sup>g</sup>u-Epenthesis does not apply before a stem-initial continuant and since the <span id = "nuy">//lh//</span> will regularly become <span id = "nuy">/dh/</span> after the stop <span id = "nuy">//G//</span> by Hardening P-18. Accordingly, to account for the type <span id = "nuy">/dhan<sup>g</sup>ara/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/wu-dhan<sup>g</sup>ara/</span> we must either label this stem an exception to n<sup>g</sup>u-Epenthesis directly, or else accomplish the same effect indirectly by having Lenition apply in the derivative form by an early application of P-16. This analysis is chosen here. The relevant stems are these:</p>
<table>
<tr><td rowspan = "3" /><td><span id = "nuy">/dhagarijgaba:ban<sup>y</sup>juj/</span></td><td>'tracks of'</td></tr>
(tr><td><span id = "nuy">/dhan<sup>g</sup>ara/</span></td><td>'flower (of)'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id = "nuy">/gadhuwa/</span></td><td>'young, new'</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Nouns to which Lenition seems to apply only in certain compounds or derivatives are these:</p>
<table>
<tr><td rowspan = "2" /><td><span id = "nuy">/ga<u>l</u>ij/</span></td><td>'fun, games'</td></tr>
(tr><td><span id = "nuy">/jarmayarmaj/</span></td><td>'long, tall' (adjectival)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>We briefly mention a few other apparent alternations of stop and continuant outside of the regular Hardening alternations described by P-18, and outside of the minority patterns just described here and described in connection with P-19.</p>
<p>First, there are a handful of alternations (ยง12.2) between verb stems and a corresponding verbal "root form" (interjection-like element which may be used as an abbreviation for a regular form or may be added to it): <span id = "nuy">/dhawa<u>d</u>!/</span> and inflected <span id = "nuy">/=lhawa<u>d</u>ba-/</span> 'to come out', <span id = "nuy">/<u>d</u>ulmurg!/</span> and inflected <span id = "nuy">/=<u>r</u>ulmurda-/</span> 'to run'. Note the dh/lh and <u>d</u>/<u>r</u> alternations. However, we do not handle the alternations with phonological rules in this analysis, since the root forms are best considered separate lexical items; they are usually suppletive, occur for only a limited number of verbs, and even when etymologically cognate are not derivable by any consistent synchronic rules. Similarly, there are a few archaic alternations of two forms for certain fauna terms, where a stop-initial form designates the adult of the species and the "lenited" form the juvenile; see dictionary entries for <span id = "nuy">/wubug/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/bubug/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/alma<u>r</u>ug/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/galma<u>r</u>ug/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/yigama/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/jigama/</span>  Again, we prefer not to set up phonological rules since these forms do not constitute a productive pattern.</p>
<p>If <span id = "nuy">/bugag/</span> 'old' is related to <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ugag/</span>  a compound final meaning 'huge', we may have another case of Lenition, at least historically.</p>
<p>The verb <span id = "nuy">/=ba<u>r</u>uma-/</span> and variants 'to roll up', derived/compounded form <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>a<u>r</u>uma-/</span>  is another probable case of Lenition. The situation is complicated by the existence of variant stem-form <span id = "nuy">/=bawa<u>r</u>uma-/</span>, which might itself be an irregular reduplication of <span id = "nuy">/=ba<u>r</u>uma-/</span>. The relationship between <span id = "nuy">/bibi/</span> '(my) mother's brother' and <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ibi/</span> '(your) mother' is etymological rather than synchronic. This is alsoy the case with <span id = "nuy">/baba/</span> '(my) father' and <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>awa<u>n</u>-/</span> in <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>awa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> 'father and child pair'. Cf. also the next section.which might itself be an irregular reduplication of <span id = "nuy">/=baruma-/</span>
