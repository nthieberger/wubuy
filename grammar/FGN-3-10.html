  <h1>3.10 w<sub>1</sub>-Deletion P-9.</h1>
<p>As noted in the preceding chapter, there are two morphophonemically distinct <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> phonemes represented as <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span>  The distinction applies clearly only in morpheme-initial position and is based primarily on whether the hardened form is <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/b/</span>  respectively (see Hardening P-18).</p>
<p>In addition to this, <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> is more frequently deleted than is <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> in some nonhardened contexts. We therefore posit a rule P-9 applying to underlying <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> only. Unfortunately, the details of the rule are tricky and the deletion is frequently optional, different speakers differing in their regular patterns. Moreover, we do not have a simple either/or rule; instead, there appear to be intermediate articulations in which a very weak and possibly inaudible <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> is produced, mostly when the adjacent vowel(s) is (are) <span id = "nuy">/a/</span></p>
<p>The situation with verbs (and adjectival nouns which can be inflected prefixally like intransitive verbs) is relatively simple. There are very few such stems beginning with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>i/</span>  Those attested are the noun root <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>in-/</span> 'flesh (of nut or shellfish)', which can be used as a compound initial in verb stems, as in <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>in=ma-/</span> 'to get the flesh of (something)'; <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>i<u>r</u>gi<u>r</u>a-/</span> 'to be skinny', a frozen reduplicative pattern showing the usual alternation of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> and (hardened) <span id = "nuy">/g/</span>  and perhaps <span id = "nuy">/=yi-wu-/</span> 'to scorch' if we set up the base form as <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>i-wu-//</span> on the basis of the synonymous compound <span id = "nuy">/-lhaln =gi-wu-/</span>  In the first two cases, the initial <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> is stable and is not deleted; in the case of 'to scorch' if set up as <span id = "nuy">//=w<sub>1</sub>i-wu-//</span>  the <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> must become <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> at an early stage in the uncompounded form <span id = "nuy">/=yi-wu-/</span>  and a later rule of w<sub>1</sub>-Palatalisation P-13 is used to account for this. Therefore none of these forms undergoes P-9.</p>
<p>There are many verbs (and adjectival nouns) beginning in <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span>  but they show no evidence of P-9 since the semivowel is usually heard on the surface (or else is hardened to <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> .</p>
<p>The remaining verbs and adjectival nouns are those which begin with <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>a(:)//</span>  Because of w<sub>1</sub>-Insertion <a href = "FGN-3-7.html#P-6">P-6</a>, which inserts <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> at the beginning of verb roots, and w-Insertion <a href = "FGN-3-8.html#P-7">P-7</a>, which inserts <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> in front of noun roots (including some adjectival roots which also have predicative forms with verbal prefixes), it is necessary to point out that we are here concerned with underlying, not derived, <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>a(:)//</span> sequences in root-initial position. This transcription is indicated when the root shows up as <span id = "nuy">//=ga(:)//</span> following pronominal prefixes ending in <span id = "nuy">//n//</span> and when the <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> is normally retained as <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> following vowels. (Note that underlying <span id = "nuy">//a(:)//</span> will result in Pronominal d-Insertion P-20 after <span id = "nuy">/n/</span> and application of VV-Contraction P-49 after vowels.)</p>
<p>In verbs and adjectival nouns beginning with <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>a(:)//</span>  the semivowel is most often deleted in word-initial position (e.g., after <span id = "nuy">/&#216;-/</span> pronominal prefix) and following a nonnasal sonorant (a combination which occurs in some compounds). In addition, when preceded by a morpheme ending in <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  the semivowel is usually weakened and is often inaudible if articulated at all, resulting in a vowel cluster with unstable hiatus <span id = "nuy">/a=a(:)/</span>  subject in rapid speech to low-level contraction to <span id = "nuy">/a:='/</span>  The weakening/deletion of <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> also occurs when the prefix ends in long <span id = "nuy">/a:/</span>  but in this case low-level contraction is not common and we usually get <span id = "nuy">/a:=a(:)/</span> with a hiatus.</p>  
<p>Examples of roots (and prefixes) subject to these alternations are: Multiple <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>ara-/</span> in verbs and a few nouns, verb root <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>aba-/</span> 'to wrap' , and adjectival noun <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>a<u>l</u>a<u>l</u>ij/</span>  all shown in the form they take after a prefix ending in <span id = "nuy">/u/</span>  for example. Word-initially we get <span id = "nuy">/ara-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/aba-/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/a<u>l</u>a<u>l</u>ij/</span>  With preceding <span id = "nuy">/a(:)/</span> we have exx. like <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-ara=ma-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span> 'I got them (ANA<sub>&#216;</sub> class) all’, which may contract to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a:-'ra=ma-n<sup>g</sup>i/</span>  The Future tense of this is <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>an<sup>g</sup>-gara=ma-ni/</span> 'I will get them all’, clearly showing underlying <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> in its hardened form <span id = "nuy">/g/</span>  were the underlying form <span id = "nuy">//-ara-//</span> without <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>//</span> the future would have been  <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>and-a: ra=ma-ni/</span> by Pronominal d-Insertion P-20.</p>
<p>There are not very many exx. involving a preceding nonnasal sonorant, since no pronominal prefix ends in such a segment. However, <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>aba:<u>r</u>u/</span> 'clean-surfaced' has a compound <span id = "nuy">/amba<u>l</u>-(w)aba:<u>r</u>u/</span> ‘bald’ with frequent omission of the parenthesised semivowel, and a few other similar forms are attested.</p>
<p>The other <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> phoneme, <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span>  normally resists deletion in these environments. Thus, from <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>argu-/</span> 'to carry on shoulder’, whose <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is guaranteed by the hardened form <span id = "nuy">/=bargu-/</span> (not  <span id = "nuy">/=gargu-/</span>  , does not normally lose its semivowel in initial position, as in <span id = "nuy">/Ø=wargu-ri-n<sup>y</sup>/</span> 'it carried it', or in other deleting positions as in <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-ara=wargu-ri-n<sup>y</sup>/</span> 'I carried them all'.</p>
<p>There are a few verbs which fluctuate between <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span>  Thus <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>ayama-/</span> 'to keep going' always shows <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> in compounds and often in the simplex, but is occasionally found with hardened <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> instead of <span id = "nuy">/b/</span> in simplex forms and thus has an alternate representation <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>1</sub>ayama-/</span>  Forms of this verb in word-initial and other deleting environments show consistent retention of the semivowel on the surface, following the expected pattern for the dominant representation <span id = "nuy">/=w<sub>2</sub>ayama-/</span></p>
<p>Summarising so far, <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> is typically deleted in root-initial (or prefix-initial) position in verb forms when preceded by zero, by <span id = "nuy">/a(:)/</span>  or by a nonnasal sonorant.</p>
<p>We now turn to (nonadjectival) nouns, whose normal environments are word-initial position, and position following inflectional and/or derivational noun class prefixes. In the case where a derivational noun class prefix immediately precedes the root, we cannot tell whether w<sub>1</sub>-Deletion applies, since undeleted <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> would then be hardened to surface <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> by P-18, while if <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> is deleted a surface <span id = "nuy">/g/</span> will be inserted anyway by Velar-Insertion <a href = "FGN-3-9.html#P-8">P-8</a>. This analysis would apply to such forms as <span id = "nuy">//maG-w<sub>1</sub>a<u>l</u>(w)ag//</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/ma-ga<u>l</u>(w)ag/</span> 'neck (of MANA class object)'.</p>
<p>In the other positions where a (nonadjectival) noun can occur (leaving aside compound-final position, which is impossible for the majority of noun roots), we do not have a sufficient range of phonological environments to distinguish clearly between <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>a/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>a/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> as initial segments of roots. The inflectional noun class prefixes all end in <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> except for <span id = "nuy">/yi:-/</span>  and as we have seen (cf. <a href = "FGN-3-8.html#P-7">P-7</a>, above) the latter induces w-Insertion anyway.</p>
<p>The patterns which emerge from this restricted set of environments are these: stable initial <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  stable initial <span id = "nuy">/wa/</span>  or fluctuation between <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/wa/</span> across informants (each speaker generally sticking with a given variant of each individual stem).</p>
<p>For example, <span id = "nuy">/arjambal/</span> 'antelopine kangaroo' and <span id = "nuy">/warmi<u>n</u>/</span> 'Saratoga fish' have always been heard in the forms shown, whether word-initial or with inflectional noun class prefix as <span id = "nuy">/ana:-'rjambal/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/na-warmi<u>n</u>/</span>  On the other hand, with nouns such as <span id = "nuy">/(w)alburun<sup>g</sup>gu/</span> 'bustard (bird sp.)' and <span id = "nuy">/(w)adba<u>r</u>/</span> 'grevillea', the semivowel is pronounced by some speakers but omitted by others. The fluctuating stems appear to range from cases where most speakers pronounce the <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> to cases where only a few do.</p>
<p>For noun stems (excluding adjectival nouns, which can occur in forms with verbal prefixes and thus a wider range of phonological contexts than ordinary nouns), it is therefore rather difficult to apply the underlying distinctions set up for verbs, with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>a/</span>  <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>a/</span>  and <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> clearly distinguished. For the small number of noun stems which can occur as compound initials or finals, we may be able to set up one of these three underlying forms with confidence, but in most of the other cases it would be speculative to differentiate <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>a/</span> from <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>a/</span>  or to argue that surface <span id = "nuy">/a/</span> can sometimes represent underlying <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>a/</span>  For most nouns, therefore, we set up initial <span id = "nuy">/wa/</span> (without numerical subscript) or <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  recognising also that for one set of nouns speakers differ in their choice of these two initial possibilities. The w<sub>1</sub>-Deletion rule P-9 is therefore not designed to apply to these ordinary nouns. It does apply, however, to a handful of nonadjectival nouns such as <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>al(w)ag/</span> 'neck', which has the form <span id = "nuy">/alwag/</span> as a simple noun but the underlying form <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>1</sub>a<u>l</u>ag/</span> (with idiosyncratic stem-internal w-deletion as well) in compounds.</p>
<p>There are no alternations in nouns between <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>i/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/i/</span>  or between <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>u/</span> and <span id = "nuy">/u/</span>  which require application of P-9.</p>

<p>I have included the environment after <span id = "nuy">/i(:)/</span> in this formulation. The actual output from <span id = "nuy">/i=w<sub>1</sub>a/</span> is either <span id = "nuy">/i=wa/</span> (where P-9, an optional rule, does not apply) or <span id = "nuy">/i=ya/</span>  the latter being more common. The latter form can be generated either by a rule converting <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> into <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> (cf. P-13, below), or else by allowing P-9 here to delete the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> and allowing y-Insertion P-10 to insert <span id = "nuy">/y/</span>  The analysis used here is the latter, so P-9 and P-10 apply in the case of surface <span id = "nuy">/i=ya/</span></p>
<p>It should be mentioned that there seems to be a tendency among younger speakers to reduce the scope of P-9, restoring surface <span id = "nuy">/w/</span> in some of the deleting environments for those roots (chiefly verbs) where the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> is clearly present in other surface forms of the same roots. Thus <span id = "nuy">/wara=aba:-'/</span> from <span id = "nuy">//=w<sub>1</sub>aba-//</span> 'to wrap' is common among my older informants, but many younger persons pronounce this <span id = "nuy">/wara=waba:-'/</span> 'they wrapped them'.</p>
