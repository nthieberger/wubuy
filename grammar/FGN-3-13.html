  <h1>3.13 Stem w<sub>2</sub>-Deletion  P-12.</h1>
<p>Ordinarily, <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> at the beginning of a stem resists deletion. However, there are two kin-term roots which show alternations of the type <span id = "nuy">/-bV/</span> after a stop vs. <span id = "nuy">/-V/</span> after a vowel or in word-initial position. We handle these by posit a basic form <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>V/</span>  with the usual <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> &#8594; <span id = "nuy">/b/</span> after stop by Hardening P-18. This requires an idiosyncratic deletion of the <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> for these stems in non-Hardening environments.</p>
<p>The more common of the two roots is <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ibi/</span> 'Mo' (Table 5-1, Bii); the base form just shown is consistent with Pl forms <span id = "nuy">/mij-bibi/</span> 'your mothers' and <span id = "nuy">/mij-bibi-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'his/her/their mothers'. With FSg prefix <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span>  however, we find <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ar-ibi/</span> 'your mother' and <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ar-ibi-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'his/her/their mother'. The reduction of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span> to <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ar-/</span> is regular before a morpheme beginning in <span id = "nuy">/i/</span> (but not, say, <span id = "nuy">/yi/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/wi/</span> , see V-Truncation P-46. We therefore need a rule converting <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ibi/</span> into <span id = "nuy">/-ibi/</span> before V-Truncation applies.</p>
<p>With no noun-class prefix, <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ibi/</span> takes the form <span id = "nuy">/yibi/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/ribi/</span> 'your mother' (add suffix <span id = "nuy">/-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> for 3rd person form). The variant <span id = "nuy">/yibi/</span> is compatible with an intermediate form <span id = "nuy">/ibi/</span>  with the <span id = "nuy">/y/</span> added as a low-level phenomenon by Initial Semivowel-Insertion <a href = "FGN-3-6.html">P-5</a>. However, <span id = "nuy">/ribi/</span> represents an optional restructuring of the basic form of the root (presumably by resegmentation of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ar-ibi/</span> as <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-ribi/</span>  influenced also by the 1Sg form <span id = "nuy">/rigan<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'my/our mother'). Speakers who consistently use <span id = "nuy">/ribi/</span> instead of <span id = "nuy">/yibi/</span> for 'your mother' (with noun-class prefix absent) require recognition of two distinct basic forms for '(your) mother', one <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>ibi/</span> to account for <span id = "nuy">/mij-bibi/</span>  and another <span id = "nuy">/ribi/</span> for the word-initial case; the simplest way to analyse <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>aribi/</span> (i.e., <span id = "nuy">/ribi/</span> with noun-class prefix present) is as <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-ribi/</span> (for <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-/</span> surface allomorph of FSg <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>ara-/</span> see discussion of Feminine Prefix-Truncation Ρ-34; this latter rule could be generalized to take care of <span id = "nuy">/n<sup>g</sup>a-ribi/</span> if needed).</p>
<p>A somewhat similar alternation occurs with <span id = "nuy">/-w<sub>2</sub>awa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> 'father and child' (with dyadic suffix), as seen in <span id = "nuy">/mij-bawa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> 'father and children' (Pl <span id = "nuy">/mij-/</span> inducing Hardening P-18 of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> to <span id = "nuy">/b/</span> . Compare prefixless <span id = "nuy">/awa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> and prefixed <span id = "nuy">/na:-'wa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> 'father and child' (the prefix is M <span id = "nuy">/na-/</span> , pointing to a form without the initial <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span>  (See Table 5-1> Aii).</p>
<p>We should caution that all of these alternations are rather frozen, and the derivations suggested highly opaque. In the case of 'father and child', there is an alternative representation with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> instead of <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span>  hence Pl <span id = "nuy">/mij-gawa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span>  though the other form is still <span id = "nuy">/awa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> with no prefix. (There are a few other stems with fluctuating initial <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span> or <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> ) For speakers with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>1</sub>/</span>  no special rule (P-12, below) is needed, since <span id = "nuy">//w<sub>1</sub>awa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij//</span> will become <span id = "nuy">/awa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span> anyway by w<sub>1</sub>-Deletion <a href = "FGN-3-10.html">P-9</a>.</p>
<p>In any event, the special rule P-12 is needed for <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>ibi/</span>  and for most speakers also for <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>awa<u>n</u>-n<sup>y</sup>ij/</span>  It is difficult to identify the precise phonological context for the rule, since there are so few relevant forms. The exx. given above show that the deletion applies word-initially and after <span id = "nuy">/a/</span>  but does not apply after <span id = "nuy">/j/</span>  The compound <span id = "nuy">/lhal-ibi-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> '(clan) country of his mother' shows deletion after <span id = "nuy">/1/</span>  Derivatives like <span id = "nuy">/ma-bibi-yun<sup>g</sup>/</span> 'its (MANA class) mother', base form <span id = "nuy">//maG-w<sub>2</sub>ibi-yun<sup>g</sup>’//</span>  show nondeletion after stop archiphoneme <span id = "nuy">/G/</span>  The evidence is incomplete, but it looks as though <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> is retained after stop or nasal, where Hardening P-18 will convert <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> to <span id = "nuy">/b/</span>  and it is deleted in non-Hardening environments. If we just order P-18 before the deletion rule, no special phonological restrictions are needed.</p>
<p>The rule applies to the only two kin terms beginning with <span id = "nuy">/w<sub>2</sub>/</span> so it is reasonable to specify this in the rule.</p>
