  <h1>5 RECOGNISING STEMS.</h1>
<p>Nunggubuyu is a language with an extremely large number of phonological rules which often have the effect of altering the surface form of stems in ways which may make it difficult for readers of the texts to identify or reconstruct the correct citation-form representation of the stem and thus find the stem in the dictionary. Moreover, verbs always have prefixes and suffixes, and nouns often do as well. We obviously cannot undertake a detailed exposition here; this is a task for the grammar. However, we can mention some of the principal phenomena which can lead to disguising stem forms.</p>
<p>To begin with, in the texts volume which appeared earlier the transcriptions show not only morpheme boundaries but also vowel elision at the beginning of morphemes. Thus the word <span id = "nuy">na:-'n<sup>y</sup>ba-jun<sup>g</sup></span> 'an/the other (man)' shows an apostrophe ' at the beginning of the stem, a device which I use solely to indicate the loss (by contraction) of a morpheme-initial vowel. The great majority of vowels deleted in this way are a or a:, since they are much more common than high vowels in morpheme-initial position. It would thus be reasonable to try to find this stem in the dictionary in the form <span id = "nuy">an<sup>y</sup>baj</span> (or <span id = "nuy">a:n<sup>y</sup>baj</span> or perhaps <span id = "nuy">wan<sup>y</sup>baj</span>, but these are alphabetised in the same way as <span id = "nuy">an<sup>y</sup>baj</span>), and if this fails perhaps <span id = "nuy">in<sup>y</sup>baj</span> or <span id = "nuy">un<sup>y</sup>baj</span> (which would be alphabetised like <span id = "nuy">yin<sup>y</sup>baj</span> and <span id = "nuy">wun<sup>y</sup>baj</span>, respectively). As it happens, <span id = "nuy">an<sup>y</sup>baj</span> is correct. One can be more precise and point out that the quality of the preceding long vowel (reflecting contraction of two vowels over a boundary) further narrows down the possibilities:.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>contracted vowel</b></td><td><b>indicates elided vowel was</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>a:</td><td>a (short or long)</td></tr>
<tr><td>i:</td><td>a, i (short or <corr original = "long" date = "2019-03-14" resp = "SM">long)</corr></td></tr>
<tr><td>u:</td><td>i, u (short or <corr original = "161.19.4" date = "2019-03-14" resp = "SM">long)</corr></td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is oversimplified but is a convenient rule of thumb for contractions involving the beginning of a noun or verb stem.</p>
<p>There are a few other rules which can disguise stem-initial segments and make stem recognition difficult. The most important rules are those which harden continuants to stops (hardening rules) or the reverse (lenition rules). The alternations are these:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>b</td><td>dh</td><td><u>d</u></td><td>j</td><td>g</td></tr>
<tr><td>w<sub>2</sub></td><td>lh</td><td><u>r</u></td><td>y</td><td>w<sub>1</sub></td></tr>
</table>
<p>There is also a marginal alternation d/r, but it applies to only a few forms and there are several counterexamples to it.</p>
Basically, the continuant becomes the corresponding stop when preceded by a nasal or stop. The nasal will show up on the surface, but some stops (notably g and archiphoneme G) will disappear after triggering hardening of a following continuant. Thus Benefactive <span id = "nuy">-aG-</span>, a very common derivational prefix for verbs, typically has no true segmental realisation of its own. From a stem <span id = "nuy">=<u>r</u>a-</span> 'to spear' we get /<span id = "nuy">-aG=<u>r</u>a-</span>/ 'to spear for (someone)', which becomes <span id = "nuy">-a=<u>d</u>a-</span> with hardening of <u>r</u> to <u>d</u> and then disappearance of the stop archiphoneme G which triggered the hardening. The <span id = "nuy">-a=<u>d</u>a-</span> will usually show up as <span id = "nuy">-'=<u>d</u>a-</span> with the vowel of the prefix elided by vowel cluster contraction.
<p>In addition to this basic hardening rule, there is also a lenition rule which applies to a modest number of lexically specified stems beginning with stops. When preceded only by a pronominal prefix the stop shows up (<span id = "nuy">niwu=dhidi-n<sup>y</sup></span> 'He blocked it off'). However, these stems shift the initial stop to the corresponding continuant when preceded by a derivational prefix or compounding initial (in addition to the pronominal prefix), so that <span id = "nuy">=dhida-</span> becomes <span id = "nuy">=lhida-</span> and so forth. (If the compound initial or derivational prefix ends in a stop or nasal, the lenited continuant is then re-hardened, so we may have complex phonological derivations involving lenition, then hardening.) If all of this is too hard to remember, readers should at least recall the stop/continuant pairs, and if a stem which occurs in a text with initial dh does not turn up in the dictionary under dh readers should then automatically check under lh.</p>
<p>There are several other more minor rules affecting a smaller number of forms. Morpheme-initial w (especially w<sub>1</sub>) is frequently realised as y when preceded by an i-vowel, chiefly in the environment i_a. Thus /<span id = "nuy">ni=w<sub>1</sub>arang<sup>g</sup>a-n<sup>y</sup></span>/ often turns up on the surface as <span id = "nuy">ni=yaran<sup>g</sup>ga-n<sup>y</sup></span>, and since wa is a very common stem-initial sequence it would be wise for readers of the texts to look first under wa rather than under ya in such combinations. Another change is the addition of n<sup>g</sup> to a stem ordinarily beginning in a when preceded by a morpheme ending in a nasal, hence /<span id = "nuy">-<u>l</u>an=adada-</span>/ becoming <span id = "nuy">-<u>l</u>an=n<sup>g</sup>adada-</span>, but such combinations are not especially frequent. Most other stem-initial changes involve such matters as alternations in vowel length and/or presence/absence of w<sub>1</sub> before stem-initial a, and because of the alphabetisation conventions used here these changes do not affect the locatability of stems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, readers who are working through Nunggubuyu materials other than my published text collection will have further difficulties. For example, fieldworkers who have transcribed Nunggubuyu words will have to identify affixes and compounding elements in order to find the stems, and this requires a reasonably good knowledge of the language. For readers interested in the texts published by Earl Hughes, I have provided an appendix here which contains my transcriptions of the more difficult words, along with morphological analysis where appropriate. However, I would suggest that readers trying to learn the language begin with my own text volume, since its transcriptions and morpheme-boundary indicators make it relatively easy to use in connection with this dictionary and the forthcoming grammar.</p>
<p>Especially in the case of short verb stems, it should be noted that stem-final vowels undergo various changes in quality, depending on the inflectional suffix. Readers should therefore thumb around in the dictionary. If the stem in the word <span id = "nuy">niwu=ma:<u>n</u>dhi-n<sup>y</sup></span> does not turn up as <span id = "nuy">=ma:<u>n</u>dhi-</span>, it might turn up as <span id = "nuy">=ma:<u>n</u>dha-</span>.</p>
