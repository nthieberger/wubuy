  <h1>1 General.</h1>
<p>This is the second volume in a projected three-part study of the Nunggubuyu language, spoken by a few hundred Aboriginals in Numbulwar Mission and nearby settlements in the southeastern part of the Arnhem Land Reserve in the Northern Territory of Australia. Some general information on the Nunggubuyu is given in appendices here, and in the introduction to the already published volume, <u>Nunggubuyu Myths and Ethnographic Texts</u>. A substantial grammar will complete the trilogy, though a later study of song 'language' is also contemplated (but not promised).</p>
<p>This is not the first Nunggubuyu dictionary, and perhaps it will not be the last. The Rev. Earl Hughes, who was for many years actively involved in studying the language, produced a <u>Nunggubuyu- English Dictionary</u> in two fascicles for Oceania Linguistic Monographs (Sydney), 1971, as his major contribution on the language. It contains a great deal of lexical material, and with due consideration to Hughes' lack of professional linguistic qualifications it is rather good on transcriptions and glosses. It has been of great value for me in preparing the present volume, and there are probably several dozen items which appear here which I would not have come across without it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a new dictionary is clearly needed, for several reasons. First, a considerable amount of new lexical material was uncovered during my fieldwork. Second, there are some transcriptional problems in Hughes' dictionary. One general problem is that Hughes recognised vowel-length distinctions only for a vs. a: (his a vs. aa), and his transcriptions of length for this vowel differ significantly from mine; in addition, I recognise length distinctions for i/i: and u/u: in addition to a/a:. More significantly, I use a rather different analysis of stem-initial segments, which makes it difficult for readers to find Hughes' entries for stems which show up in my text collection. Specifically, stem-initial vowels are generally not recognised by Hughes, with the result that stems which I write as =a:ru-, =agi-, etc. show up as "rru" and "gi."</p>
<p>These reasons seem to me to add up to considerable justification for publishing a new dictionary.</p>
<p>This is an 'ethnographic' dictionary, just as any decent dictionary of a living Aboriginal language must be. A large percentage of the lexical entries involve unmistakably 'cultural' vocabulary, if indeed any vocabulary at all can be considered 'noncultural'. Because the lexical semantics of Nunggubuyu is so unlike that of English, it would ideally require several paragraphs of commentary to adequately describe the meaning and usage of each stem. Neither my own competence nor the publisher's printing budget are adequate to this task, but an effort has been made to make this dictionary as ethnographically revealing as possible within these limitations.</p>
<p>The organisation of the volume is therefore based on two major decisions. The first is to arrange the English-Nunggubuyu section of the dictionary in part in thesaurus-type format, so that readers can get some idea of how lexical domains involving numerous individual stems are organised. (Similarly, the individual stem entries in the main part frequently contain direct cross-references to other stems with similar or associated meanings.) Secondly, the stem entries contain a great number of cross-references to specific passages in the published text collection, so that serious students can see how these stems are used in context (the published texts are primarily myths and ethnographic texts, along with a few anecdotal and historical ones). Unfortunately, a certain percentage of the stems are not represented in the text collection, or have only one or two attestations which are not sufficient to clarify their range of meanings. However, many of the stems are multiply attested, and by listing the relevant passages here we can, in effect, provide considerable potential information about them to readers even though the dictionary gloss by itself might be perfunctory. I have also been very much concerned with the matter of the author's accountability to readers; by putting emphasis on textual cross-references, I give readers the opportunity to test, and perhaps go beyond, my glosses for those stems which occur repeatedly, and I implicitly warn readers that glosses which are not supported by textual examples are perhaps less authoritative than those for multiply attested items. (Some of the stems which are listed with no textual example are items which I initially obtained from Hughes' dictionary and then checked with one or two speakers; the glosses given here are based on these speakers' statements about the items, usually without full contextualization, and in some cases I may have been too predisposed to accept Hughes' gloss as basically correct.)</p>
<p>The present dictionary does not include stems which occur only as song epithets. I have recorded several hundred such stems in my song texts, but do not feel that this is the place to publish them. A great many are multisyllabic but unanalysable stems with the same denotation as an ordinary-language word presented here, and publishing them here would not materially contribute to an understanding of Nunggubuyu semantic structure. I hope, however, to publish the song texts at some future time along with an essay on the song 'language'.</p>
<p>With this exception, it is my hope that this dictionary is sufficient to characterise the structure of Nunggubuyu lexicon with sufficient precision and completeness to permit meaningful comparative studies, particularly with other Australian languages. I would also expect that future fieldworkers working with Nunggubuyu people, including anthropologists, would be able to find basic materials here for the initial study of the semantic domains which interest them, though an intensive study of almost any single domain would have to go considerably beyond what is here offered.</p>
<p>I would also like to express the hope that more effort might be put into producing dictionaries of Australian languages than has been the case to date. Although many fieldworkers (including Bible translators and literacy personnel) have extensive lexical files, the number of adequate published dictionaries is scandalously low. Aside from the large Pintupi dictionary by the Hansens, I do not know of a single published dictionary which makes any pretensions of being comprehensive. In particular, the 'academic' linguists have essentially contented themselves with long grammatical studies, squeezing out 'theoretical' conclusions of various sorts, and have as yet published few or no texts and no adequate dictionaries. I suspect that the next generation of linguists, not to mention the Aboriginals themselves, will judge their predecessors harshly for this behaviour, which not only renders meaningless the linguists' professions of providing support for Aboriginals but is also selfdefeating even for purposes of theoretical analysis. One of the great challenges in analysing the grammatical systems of these languages and comparing them to better-known languages is in identifying the division of labour between lexicon and morphosyntax. I deal with some of these issues in appendices here and expect to return to the issue in the forthcoming grammar.</p>
