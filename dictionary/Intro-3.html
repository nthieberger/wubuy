  <h1>3 STEM CLASSES.</h1>
<p>In each entry in the Nunggubuyu-English section, the stem is followed by an abbreviation like <u>NcAna&#216;</u> or <u>VIntrA2</u> giving information about the word class and inflectional type of the stem.</p>
<p>For verbs, this abbreviation begins with <u>VIntr</u> (intransitive) or <u>VTr</u> (transitive), indicating verbal voice. This specifies whether the pronominal prefix on the verb marks merely one participant (intransitive subject) or two (transitive subject and object). Some formally intransitive verbs in this sense, like the compound <corr original = "-w<sup>l</sup>al(a)=n<sup>g</sup>u-" date = "2019-03-14" resp = "SM"><span id = "nuy">-w<sub>l</sub>al(a)=n<sup>g</sup>u-</span> 'to drink', can occur in clauses with an additional NP designating the notional direct object (here, some liquid), so the labels <u>VIntr</u> and <u>VTr</u> do not necessarily indicate clause-level case frames.</p>
<p>The label <u>VIntr</u> or <u>VTr</u> is followed by an inflectional-class marker such as <u>I1</u> or <u>A3</u>. The paradigms of the many inflectional classes cannot be given here but will be given, of course, in the grammar. For a handful of irregular verbs no class marker is shown.</p>
<p>A certain number of morphologically inert elements are marked as <u>Particle</u> or <u>Interjection</u>. The label <u>Rf</u>, for 'root form', is used with certain interjection-like elements with verb-like sense, often used as abbreviations for a full verb form or as an adjunct thereto. Some derivational affixes, including stems used only as compound initials, are labeled <u>Pref</u> (prefix) or <u>Suff</u> (suffix).</p>
<p>However, the majority of stems other than verbs are nouns of one type or another. The abbreviations in the lexical entries make the following primary distinctions: <u>Nk</u> (kin noun), <u>Nc</u> (common or ordinary noun), <u>Nc/Pref</u> (stem used as common noun or as compound initial), <u>NcAna(Adv)</u> (noun formally of Ana noun class, but used chiefly as adverb), and <u>NAdj</u> (adjectival noun).</p>
<p>If the symbol <u>Nc/Pref</u> is used on the top line of the entry, immediately after the citation form of the stem, this means that the stem is not used in that form as a full noun stem. It can be used as a compound initial (hence <u>Pref</u>), but if it is to be used as an ordinary independent noun (<u>Nc</u>) it must undergo a derivational extension in which a special set of derivational noun-class prefixes, NC<sub>der</sub>-, is used. The combination of a <u>Nc/Pref</u> root plus a NC<sub>der</sub>-prefix generates a full-fledged surface noun stem which can then take inflectional affixes (including the outer, or inflectional, noun-class prefixes) just like other nouns. The NC<sub>der</sub>- prefixes are:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>noun class</td><td>NC<sub>der</sub>- prefix</td></tr>
<tr><td>Na and MSg</td><td>niG</td></tr>
<tr><td>N<sup>g</sup>ara and FSg</td><td>n<sup>g</sup>ariG-</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ana</td><td>uG</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mana</td><td>maG</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wara and P1</td><td>uG- (same as Ana)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Thus, the stem <span id = "nuy">-jan<sup>g</sup>-</span> <u>Nc/Pref</u> 'root' can be used without change as a compound initial, say with a following verb stem. As an independent noun, however, it must undergo this derivational process. Typically, it acquires a NC<sub>der</sub>- prefix agreeing in class with the noun which designates the tree or other plant as a whole; if we are talking about the root of the kurrajong tree, yarawug (Mana class), we get /<span id = "nuy">maG-jan<sup>g</sup></span>/, surface <span id = "nuy">ma-n<sup>g</sup>u-jan<sup>g</sup></span> after phonological rules. For some <u>Nc/Pref</u> stems there is a convention that a particular noun class is optionally generalisable (usually Ana or Mana, depending on the stem), with whole-part noun-class concord then only optional, and in this case the dictionary entry should indicate which is the unmarked surface form.</p>
<p><u>NAdj</u> stems likewise have no inherent noun class as such, but acquire a surface noun class in given contexts by being related to a particular noun or real-world referent. However, the principal formal difference used here in identifying <u>NAdj</u> stems (as opposed to others) is not this, but the ability of <u>NAdj</u> stems to occur as clause-predicates with intransitive-subject prefixes. Nouns which, like nuga 'stone', do not occur in such forms, are labeled <u>Nc</u>, while those like yiwanggu 'old (man)' which do are labeled <u>NAdj</u>. Most specifically human nouns (other than kin terms), such as those translatable 'boy', 'woman', 'boss', and the like, are <u>NAdj</u> stems, while nouns such as flora-fauna terms and implement terms are <u>Nc</u>.</p>
<p>Some <u>Nc</u> stems are listed as <u>NcAna(Adv)</u>, which means that they are generally used as adverbs of various kinds (though 'adverb' is not a well-defined Nunggubuyu word class). Formally, they belong to the Ana class, and occasionally take one of the respective noun-class prefix forms, but most often they occur in non-nuclear syntactic position (hence without verbal concord) and without affixes. They can be thought of as a kind of defective noun, typically used like particles but with residual nominal status. The best way to test whether a given element is a true particle (uninflectable) or a <u>NcAna(Adv)</u> is to use it in a negative clause, which makes noun-class prefixation obligatory; if the prefix ana- appears it is <u>NcAna(Adv)</u>, otherwise it is a particle.</p>
<p>Nouns other than those already discussed are normally assigned the abbreviation <u>NcNa</u>, <u>NcNgara</u>, <u>NcAnaWu</u>, <u>NcAna&#216;</u>, <u>NcMana</u> or <u>NcWara</u> immediately after the citation form at the beginning of the lexical entry. This indicates the inherent noun class (Na, etc.) characteristic of the noun when used as an independent stem. <u>NcAnaWu</u> and <u>NcAna&#216;</u> represent two subclasses of the <u>NcAna</u> class, distinguishable only by verbal concord of objects. Thus <span id = "nuy">n<sup>g</sup>awu=na-ni</span> 'I saw it (AnaWu)' but <span id = "nuy">n<sup>g</sup>a=na-ni</span> 'I saw it (Ana&#216;)'. The <u>NcAna(Adv)</u> stems discussed above cannot usually be specifically identified as to subclass, since these stems are not found in direct object function except in highly contrived contexts, but they are undoubtedly best assumed to be in the <u>NcAnaWu</u> subclass (which is characteristic of nouns denoting locations, times, etc., including place names).</p>
<p>Some nouns listed as <u>NcAna&#216;</u>, <u>NcMana</u> or whatever also have derivatives with NC<sub>der</sub>- prefixes and/or can be used as compound initials. This information is given later on in the lexical entry, but no special cover symbol for such nouns, as opposed to nouns which cannot occur in such contexts, is provided.</p>
