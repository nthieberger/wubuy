  <h1>2 Orthography.</h1>
<p>The orthographic system used here has previously been utilised in the published text collection, so an elaborate justification will not be necessary here. The letter h is used solely as a diacritic indicating interdental laminal articulation in lh, nh, dh. Underlining of <u>n</u> <u>d</u> <u>l</u> indicates retroflexion. The two rhotics are glide (approximant) <u>r</u> and tap r. Velar nasal is n<sup>g</sup>, palatoalveolar laminal nasal is n<sup>y</sup>. Palatoalveolar laminal stop is j. Semivowels are y and w. The sequence ng is a cluster of n followed by g, ly is 1 followed by y, and so forth.</p>
<p>Basic vowels are a, i, u and their long counterparts a:, i:, u:. The sequence as is a cluster of two vowels (with two syllabic peaks), though this sequence is sometimes contracted to a long a:.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular phonemes, a few morphophonemic symbols are used in citation forms of stems and affixes. The symbol N is used for an unspecified nasal archiphoneme which is realised on the surface as a nasal homorganic to a following consonant (unless it is zeroed). It is alphabetised like n. The symbol G is likewise employed for an unspecified stop (I have used D in some earlier publications) which has no direct surface realisation but which has a hardening effect (like g and other stops) on following consonants. Both N and G occur in this transcriptional system exclusively in morpheme-final position. G is alphabetised like g.</p>
<p>Morpheme-initially, a distinction is made in citation forms between w<sub>1</sub> and w<sub>2</sub>. The principal difference is that, in hardening environments, w1 becomes g while w2 becomes b. In addition, w<sub>1</sub> is more likely than w<sub>2</sub> to disappear word-initially before a or medially when surrounded by a-vowels, and is more likely to become y in the environment i_a. The difference between w<sub>1</sub> and w<sub>2</sub> is not considered in alphabetisation. In some cases a stem is given in citation forms with the initial semivowel specified as w without diacritics, either because the w cannot occur for some reason in hardening environments or because of inadequate data.</p>
<p>The alphabetical order adopted here is based on that of English, with interdentals preceding orthographically simple consonants and retroflexed consonants following, and with ng and ny following n. The order is therefore:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>b</td><td>dh</td><td>d</td><td><u>d</u></td><td>g</td><td>j</td><td>lh</td><td>1</td><td><u>1</u></td><td>m</td><td>nh</td><td>n</td><td><u>n</u></td><td>n<sup>g</sup></td><td>n<sup>y</sup></td><td>r</td><td><u>r</u></td><td>w</td><td>y</tr>
</table>
<p>All stems are treated as though beginning in a consonant for purposes of alphabetisation. Stems beginning in a or a: are alphabetised as though beginning in wa(:), those in i as though beginning in yi, those in u as though beginning in wu. This is because extensive morphophonemic alternations between initial a(:) and wa(:), and so forth, would make finding entries difficult if the vowel-initial stems were listed separately from the others. See below for further discussion.</p>
<p>In citation forms, the = boundary is used before verb stems. (In complete word transcriptions, = is also used before NAdj (adjectival) stems when functioning as predicates with intransitive verbal prefixes.) The - boundary is used for other morpheme breaks, but nouns are usually shown without these boundaries in citation forms if they can occur without affixes (as is usually the case).</p>
