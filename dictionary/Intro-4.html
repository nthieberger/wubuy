  <h1>4 THE STRUCTURE OF LEXICAL ENTRIES.</h1>
<p>In the Nunggubuyu-English section, each entry begins with a citation form of the stem. This is normally directly followed by an abbreviation indicating word-class and inflectional class, as just outlined. If the entry has to be broken up into two or more distinct parts, involving distinct syntactic or morphological classes, the abbreviation (e.g., <u>NcAnaWu</u>) is given at the beginning of a numbered subsection of the entry (see the entry of <span id = "nuy">w<sub>2</sub>unga:ri</span>, for example). Glosses are given, followed if possible by numerical sequences like 6.3.1 or 66.1.4. These indicate specific textual examples of the stem in my volume of Nunggubuyu texts. 6.3.1 means Text 6, section 3, line 1. Readers seriously interested in semantics, interested in studying case frames of verbs, or the like should take the trouble to examine these textual passages. If an item occurs repeatedly in a given text I just indicate the text number ('Text 65') instead of giving a list of several specific lines therein. The abbreviation '6.3.lrdp' provides the further information that the example in 6.3.1 is a reduplication (chiefly for verbs), while '6.3.lpred' would mean that the example in 6.3.1 is a predicative form (for a NAdj stem). '6.3.1ff.' means, of course, that examples occur in 6.3.1 and following lines.</p>
<p>Additional remarks concerning particular entries are of several types. Lists of semantically associated vocabulary items usually begin with 'Cf.'. Lists of synonyms or near-synonyms (using these terms somewhat loosely) are usually prefaced by 'Syn:'. A few entries have etymological discussions, mainly in the fashion of internal reconstruction (I avoid, in general, listing cognates elsewhere), and these commentaries begin with 'Etym:'.</p>
<p>Warnings are occasionally given not to confuse one stem with a phonologically similar or identical one. In the case of verbs whose citation forms are identical, I indicate the presence of the other stems by a postposed numerical superscription. Thus, when a reader looking for a stem which occurs in a textual example as =lha- finds an entry beginning with <span id = "nuy">=lha-<sup>1</sup></span>, he or she is thereby warned that there is at least one other verbal entry to follow with the same citation form (except for a different number). Another warning is '(uncommon)', meaning that the item is significantly less common in my data than a (near-)synonym or than the English gloss suggests; in the former case the synonym is marked '(common)'.</p>
<p>Compounds are shown listed separately under the stem considered to be the nuclear element in the compound. These compounds are indented only three spaces from the left margin. Commonly the compound has the same word- and morphological class as the uncompounded stem, and therefore abbreviations like <u>NcAnaWu</u> and <u>VTrA2</u> are normally omitted unless they differ from that applied to the uncompounded stem. Where only transitivity is different in the compound, this may be indicated by adding '(Intr !)' or '(Tr !)' after the citation form of the compound, with the ! used for emphasis. Compounds are usually given only once, in the entry of the nuclear stem; the entry of the nonnuclear stem does not present the compound in full but does have a line reading something like 'As cpd. initial: see <span id = "nuy">=w<sub>2</sub>alga-</span>, <span id = "nuy">=w<sub>2</sub>agiwa-</span>', which means that the compound is presented in the entries of the stems listed.</p>
<p>A rough distinction between compounds and routine derivatives is made here, though not rigorously justified by the grammar. For verbs, the main prefixal derivatives are Comitative (Comit) <span id = "nuy">-an<sup>y</sup>ji-</span>, Benefactive (Benef) <span id = "nuy">-aG-</span> or <span id = "nuy">-wa:G-</span>, several Multiple (Mult) morphemes including <span id = "nuy">â€“w<sub>1</sub>ara-</span> and <span id = "nuy">-n<sup>g</sup>araG-/-n<sup>g</sup>aran-</span>, and <span id = "nuy">-an<sup>g</sup>gara-</span> 'together'. These do not change transitivity or inflectional class, except that Benef. verbs are inflected transitively with the object marker representing the indirect object. Suffixal derivatives are Causative (Caus) <span id = "nuy">-jga-</span> or <span id = "nuy">-jgi-</span>, Reflexive (Ref1) <span id = "nuy">-i-</span>, and Reciprocal (Recip) <span id = "nuy">-n<sup>y</sup>ji-</span>. These change transitivity in the usual way, and produce verbs which take the following morphological classes (which do not have to be explicitly labeled at each occurrence): <span id = "nuy">-jga-</span> is <u>VTrA1</u>, <span id = "nuy">-jgi-</span> is <u>VTrI1</u>, <span id = "nuy">-i-</span> is <u>VIntrI1</u> (except for one or two instances of <u>VIntrI2</u>), and <span id = "nuy">-n<sup>y</sup>ji-</span> is <u>VIntrI2</u>. All of these derivatives, prefixal as well as suffixal, are listed below the gloss for the underived stem, indented in six (not three) spaces and thus differentiated from the compounds. (However, Mult. prefix <span id = "nuy">-w<sub>1</sub>are-</span> is sometimes used as a kind of neutral compound initial, so there is some fluctuation as to whether forms which contain it are indented three or six spaces.)</p>
<p>For nouns the most usual derivatives of this type are NC<sub>der</sub>- prefix forms (discussed above), and (for <u>NAdj</u>) the following two suffixal derivatives producing verbs: Factitive (Fact) <span id = "nuy">-w<sub>1</sub>a-</span> (surface -wa-, -ga-, -ya-) 'to cause (direct object), to be/become X (e.g., big)'; Inchoative (Inch) <span id = "nuy">-ma-</span> 'to be/become X'. These are both of Al inflectional class.</p>
<p>For <u>Nk</u> (kin terms), the various stem forms (for 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person propositus, and dyadic terms) are listed separately with cross-references. Similarly, cardinal-direction adverbs and other stems with irregular alternations are usually presented with each major form listed separately.</p>
